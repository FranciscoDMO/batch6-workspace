One of them is the ERA statistic for\\n: pitchers. What does it say ??\\n\\nERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per\\nnine inning game.  Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned\\nrun, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA\\nis 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided\\nby the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.\\n\\n\\tERA = (ER/IP) * 9\\n\\nAn earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed\\nto a fielding error.  More specifically, if an error occurs that represented\\nthe third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs.\\nEarned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base\\nwhen the pitcher exited the game.  Here are some examples:\\n\\n\\tIf there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base.  If\\n\\tan error occurs that represents the third out, all of the runs after\\n\\tthis error and NOT counted as earned runs.\\n\\n\\tIf a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks), and leaves the game\\n\\tbefore the inning is completed, he is responsible for the people who\\n\\twere left on base.  If the those runners who were left on base score,\\n\\tand the score was not a result of an error, those eraned runs are\\n\\tattributed to the pitcher who left the game.\\n\\nI hope this explains things for you.Reports in Ottawa today say that the Senators have come to a verbal\\nagreement with last seasons first pick and 2nd overall choice Alexei\\nYashin on a 5 year deal. As well the Senators have signed their second\\nround pick Chad Penney who is currently playing for the Sault Ste. Marie\\nGreyhounds in the Ontario Junior league playoffs.     writes...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write, but\\nneither of you two *sound* as though you have kids, and you may not have\\nspouses either.\\n\\nConsider a night game starting at 7:05 PM EST.  (It was 7:35 last year,\\nbut Cleveland showed what I thought was good sense in pushing it back.)\\nI go, and I\\'m into it until 11 PM minimum.  Extra innings could put me\\nwell past midnight.  Even without extra innings, if the score is beyond\\n2-1 I can\\'t see my family that night at all.  If the next day is a workday,\\nI may have to bag that as well.  Further, the later the game goes, the\\ncolder it gets on the shore of Lake Erie.\\n\\nAll that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game.

As much\\nas fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning\\nthe game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that\\nthis is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win\\nin any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first\\ninstinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch\\nit himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.\\n\\nI enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against \\nvisiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the\\nfield.\\n\\nNow, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or\\nnot.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his\\nfirst responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win.\\nHere are the standings after game 1 of each of the divisional semi-finals.\\n(Hey, look who\\'s #4!)

Angeles 2\\n\\nFinals:\\nPittsburgh 26, Boston 5, Detroit 4, Toronto 2, Quebec 2, Los Angeles 1, Chicago\\n1\\n\\nGood luck to all!\\nIt was unlikely, improbable.  For the Bruins, it was the stuff of\\nnightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.  \\n   For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three\\ngames of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a\\nbest of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this\\ntime.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.\\n   On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston\\'s home ice\\nadvantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It\\nwasn\\'t easy.  It wasn\\'t always pretty.  It still worked.\\n   John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting\\ngoaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday.\\nBuffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on\\nthe powerplay, with Boston\\'s Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box.\\nLaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was\\nKhmylev\\'s first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres\\nstole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and\\nHannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a\\nshot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob\\nSweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split of\\npenalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston\\'s Smolinski get\\nhis first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes\\nlater, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied\\nthe game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime.\\nLast year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweet\\nrevenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a\\ntip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime.\\nBoth teams finished with 34 shots.  \\n        Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.\\n        Referee--Rob Shick.\\n\\nComments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of\\nclutching and grabbing.  Buffalo\\'s penalty killing unit was fantastic\\nagain.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead\\nflung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea\\nto Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever\\nheard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was\\nonly five when they played for the cup.  I don\\'t remember it and no\\none took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview,\\nnoted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was\\ntoo loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn\\'t seem to matter, as\\nmost of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev\\ndidn\\'t seem to realize that he was the game\\'s third star and didn\\'t\\nskate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each\\nwere out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked in\\nan interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he\\nresponed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than\\nthat, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).  The\\ninterviewer seemed to think just because he doesn\\'t speak English, he\\nmust not understand playoffs.  Uh-huh. \\nOkay, the Caps AGAIN are about to break out the golf clubs but before they\\ndo, does anyone have the history of the Washington Capitals\\' futility\\nrecord in the playoffs? I remember that Terry\\'s first year was the first\\nyear that the Caps finally made it to the third round but before under\\nBrian, I noticed that every other year the Caps got to the second round\\nand the years in between they didn\\'t make it past the first round. Is this\\ntrend continuning? \\nThe Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan.\\nP.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh!\\n____________________________________________________________________________\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\nGiant\\'s have a five man rotation of  John Burkett, Trevor Wilson,\\nBill Swift, Jeff Brantley, and Bud Black/Dave Burba.

They have a rrally good chance to come\\n            out of the Smythe Division, and a chance to make \\n            it to the finals, but no one is capable this year\\n            of beating the Penguins, they have too many\\n            scoring threats.

They\\'ll lose in the first round, compliments of Winnipeg\\nand Teemu Selanne.  Note:  I\\'m not posting this as part of an argument with Roger Meynard,\\nbut as an independent sort of thread.  I do actually quote some things\\nthat Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as\\n\"sampling\" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what\\nI want to say.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball\\nteam and some people\\'s conception of a biological organism.  In the\\nbiology context, we would very likely read \"fitness\" for \"the score of\\nthe game\" and \"organisms\" for \"teams\".  How we interpret \"players\" is\\ntrickier, but either \"organs\", or \"genes\" might seem reasonable\\nchoices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A \"genes\"\\ninterpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, \\nbut that would be a different and probably longer post.\\n\\nIf, however, we take the \"organ\" view, then our knowledge of biology\\nshould make us pause before we start saying things like \"species X is\\nmore fit than species Y because of a better organ Z\".  Given what we\\nknow about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious\\nof such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often\\nmade when you map \"species X\" onto \\'humans\\', and \"organ Z\" onto\\n\\'brain\\').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem\\nmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. \\'brain\\'\\nabove might be more reasonable than \\'pancreas\\' assuming no gross\\npathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).\\n\\nEven when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the\\nfunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ\\nmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.\\n(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial\\nin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any\\nkind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is\\nnot some completely magical unanalyzable \"whole\" but an intriguing\\nprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are\\npotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to\\nparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple\\norgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I\\nthink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved\\nin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.\\n\\n\\nOne thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly\\ncontrolled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of\\ncourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they\\ncan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the\\nabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,\\nbut even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.\\n\\n\\nIn this cases, we\\'re seeing the word \"statistics\" means \"summary of\\nobserved events\", where the events themselves can be viewed as the\\noutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.\\nThus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together\\ninto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might\\ngive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.\\n\\n\\nThis statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.\\nFitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;\\nyou might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to\\nbaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an\\nenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least\\na nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the\\nleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any\\nof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly\\nlarge random component in the performance of each team that is\\ndifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors\\nintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in\\nbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the\\nWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component\\nmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,\\nand both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement\\nwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but\\nit\\'s unclear what it all really means.\\n\\n***\\n\\nNow just one more un-related point:\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the\\noutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of\\nteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this\\nbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.\\nBut this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule\\ngives you a little hope that bad hops aren\\'t the only difference\\nbetween the winners and the losers.\\n\\nMoreover, you\\'ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World\\nSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict\\nthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only\\nto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.\\n\\n\\nSince stats are summaries of events, it\\'s true that if you know the\\nevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to\\nunderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new\\nknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and\\nuseful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge\\nin a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge\\neven though I\\'m relying on stats to do it.\\nSigh.  Here we go again.                     \\n\\n\\nMust I?  If I were to say that batting average is a predictor that \\ncan be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a\\nhit on a particular plate appearance, is that only valid if I can\\ndefine the skill in hitting a baseball?  That\\'s all I\\'ve said, \\nexcept I used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations.\\n\\n\\nI did not say I could predict the future.  I\\'ve suggested that the\\nstatistic is not necessarily meaningless.  Here\\'s the data for this\\nsituation:\\n\\n\\t\\tNon-Clutch\\t\\t\\tClutch\\t \\n\\t\\tAB\\tH\\tBA\\t\\tAB\\tH\\tBA\\n\\nSabo\\t\\t1539\\t452\\t.294\\t\\t259\\t59\\t.228\\nSamuel\\t\\t1564\\t383\\t.245\\t\\t278\\t83\\t.299\\t\\n\\n\\nIf you were to have been the Reds manager at that time, I assume you\\nwould have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch-\\nhitting Samuel.  I\\'m sure some of that basis would have utilized\\nprior performance.  You just wouldn\\'t have used this particular\\naspect of prior performance.  Is this not correct?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne more time.  I did *not* claim to be able to predict the future.\\nI said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would\\nhave had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo.\\n\\nAnd I am not dismissing your work.  I\\'m stating my opinion.\\nYou are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary\\ninvalid, so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult\\nto your work.\\n\\n\\n\\nI did not say that clutch-hitting is well defined.\\n\\n\\tI said that the data is significant  to me.\\n\\nI did not say that it is a consistent skill.\\n\\n\\tI have said that it is an indicator of performance under a\\n\\tcertain set of circumstances.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, [big sigh]\\n\\n\\nI have NOT\\n\\tNOT\\n\\t NOT\\n\\t  NOT\\n\\t   NOT\\n\\t    NOT\\n\\t     NOT EVER called you or anyone else on r.s.b. \"stupid\".\\n\\n\\nIt is nice, however, to see that you will consider the possibility\\nthat you actually could have some preconceived biases.\\n\\n\\n\\nAh.  I knew we could get to the name calling.  And there\\'s that word\\nyou like so much.\\n\\n\\n\\nWait a minute.  I thought I first had to define clutch hitting.\\nDo I, or don\\'t I?\\n\\n\\nI made two statements in my post.\\n\\n1.\\tI am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting.\\n\\n2.\\tI would have hit for Sabo.\\n\\n\\nAs for #2, many of us make a number of written statements through \\nthis media about what we think will happen in baseball.  I\\'m not\\nshy about it.  I\\'ll make the statement again.  I believe that by\\nseason\\'s end that Chris Sabo\\'s batting average in clutch situations\\nwill be significantly lower than his batting average in non-clutch\\nsituations.  I can\\'t prove that it will happen, so I guess we\\'ll \\njust have to wait and see.\\n\\n\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - -\\nHere\\'s another one for you.  In 1989 - 1991 Joe Carter\\'s batting\\naverage in clutch situations was significantly below his batting\\naverage in non-clutch situations each year.  I presume you think\\nthis is random.  \\n\\nNon-Clutch:\\t1585 AB\\t\\t411 H\\t\\t.259\\nClutch:\\t\\t 338 AB\\t\\t 68 H\\t\\t.201\\n\\nSo what could we expect in 1992 from Mr. Carter?\\n\\nWell, his composite BA through 1989 was .268;  through 1990 was\\n.262;  through 1991 was .263, so I think we have a pretty good\\nidea of what kind of batting average he can produce.  In 1992\\nhe hit .264.  Not surprising, huh?  Also in 1992: \\n\\nNon-Clutch:\\t 536 AB\\t\\t144 H\\t\\t.269\\nClutch:\\t\\t  86 AB\\t\\t 20 H\\t\\t.233\\n\\nNo, this doesn\\'t prove any overall statistical trend that can\\nbe used to predict future performance across the breadth of \\nmajor league ballplayers.  It just makes me think that in 1993\\nJoe Carter\\'s batting average in the clutch is not going to be\\nas high as his ba in non-clutch situations.\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n \\nAs for #1 (above), I have plenty of company.  John Dewan of STATS,INC. is\\nthe editor of The Scouting Report wherein the statistics regarding\\nclutch hitting are compiled, reported and referenced in the text.\\nBill James makes numerous references to a player\\'s ability to hit\\nwell in the clutch.  I am not saying that I can predict the future\\nany more than they are.   You (and others) are saying that your\\nwork renders their statements (and mine) meaningless.  I don\\'t \\naccept that, which in your words proves that I am a \"total idiot\".\\n\\n\\n\"Stupid\".  \"Total idiot\".  \\n\\nMy, my.  Such hostility.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\nI\\'m looking for software (hopefully free and runs on Unix box) which will\\nkeep track of statistics for my company softball team (batting avg. etc.).\\n\\nIf you know of any please post or respond to me by e-mail. Many thanks.\\n\\nI remember one he hit circa 1976 at Wrigley Field that went across\\nthe street (in dead center field) and hit a house on the roof.

his broadcasts or whether\\nhe\\'s a Canadian thing altogether.  Seriously, what is he all about?  I\\nknow he was a coach at one time, and from the volume of posts about him,\\nSOMEONE surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow, but my question\\nis, what is the deal with him?  Secondly, are the comments of his that I\\nread about on the net merely flame bait, or do people actually take him\\nseriously?  I gotta tell you, from what I see, he really sounds like an\\nass.  Let me know - maybe I\\'m missing something.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSorry, but this is the biggest load of bunk I\\'ve seen in a while. \\na) The Pirates have been trying to trade LaValliere for some time now.\\nNobody was even vaguely interested.\\nb) Several other teams had made it known that they would grab Prince,\\nwho was out of options.\\nc) LaValliere\\'s release had nothing to do with him being through. He\\nwas released, because, in the event of an injury to Slaught,\\nLaValliere is no longer capable (they believe) of being the everyday\\ncatcher.\\n\\nSince Slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties,\\nthe offense should actually improve with this move.It was my impression watching the Mets & Rockies that umpires were\\ncalling strikes above the belt, too, but not as far up as the letters.\\nIt would be nice if this were the case.A lot of teams carry 3 catchers on their 25 man roster,\\nbut the 3rd catcher is seldom ever used.  He is only\\ninsurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher\\nis injured during a game.     So to free up this roster\\nspot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not\\ninvoke a catcher re-substitution rule:\\n\\nIf the last roster catcher on a team is\\ninjured during a game, the team is permitted\\nto substitute in his place for defensive purposes\\na catcher who has previously been yanked from\\nthe game.   \\n\\nGiven this rule, a team wouldn\\'t need 3 roster\\ncatchers.  The 3rd catcher could be playing\\nin AAA or be a non-roster bullpen catcher.It\\'s in the FAQ.\\n\\nhave fun\\ngak\\n\\nQuite honestly, this one is ridiculous.  Consider the following\\nscenario: Runner on third. As the pitcher starts to throw home, the\\nrunner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for\\nthe suicide squeeze. The pitcher, seeing this, does not throw home,\\nbut stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down.  It is the\\nbalk rule that prevents this from happening.  \\n\\nBelieve it or not, this actually happened to me once in an OBA\\n(Ontario Baseball association) game in Milton, Ontario.  I was the\\nbatter and to my amazement, the umpire missed it.  In the 12 years\\nthat I played ball, this was worst piece of umpiring I ever saw.\\nSomeone tell me there\\'s a :-) hidden here somewhere... ???\\n-- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at BoulderI saw a previous request for the Rules and Instructions for the USENET \\nplayoff pool but I haven\\'t seen any responce.

(\"stand STILL...dam sunavbich...HMFF\")\\n\\nHey Valentine, I don\\'t see Boston with any world series rings on their\\nfingers.  Damn, Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his \\nfuture.  Therefore, I would have to say Toronto easily made the best \\nsigning.  And don\\'t tell me Boston will win this year.  They won\\'t \\neven be in the top 4 in the division, more like 6th.\\nSpeaking of spelling errors on the Cup, I wonder if the \"h\" in\\nPittsburgh made it to the Cup.  You know how funny people can\\nbe about spelling Pittsburgh.\\nThat\\'ll teach me not to qualify my statements...\\n\\n\\nOK, something to shoot for.  The Royals will score 531 runs or less\\nthis season (although they just decided to get McRae out of the\\nleadoff spot :-( )\\n\\nOf course, Valentine will throw this one back in my face when the\\nRoyals even manage to outscore another AL team.\\n\\n\\nSean\\nAmazingly, pitchers, no matter how good their mechanics, are\\nnot machines.  Cy Young winners don\\'t pitch in a vaccuum, unaware\\nof how their offenses are doing.\\n\\n\\tThe Braves\\' pitching staff is already showing signs of\\ncracking under the strain of knowing they\\'re not going to get many\\n(if any) runs.  Unfortunately, the Braves\\' pitchers were so bad for so\\nlong that the organization put so much stress (and I mean *stress*)\\non pitching that they completely ignored hitting.\\n\\n\\tThe Braves right now are looking woefully similar to the Braves of\\nthe mid-seventies.  Heaven help us.\\n I hear ya!  Then again, we must remember that we are indeed Cub fans, and\\nthat the Cubs will eventually blow it.  After all, the Cubs are the easiest\\nteam in the National League to root for.  No Pressure.  You know they will\\nlose eventually.  Oh well, I suppose we must have faith.  After all, they\\ndo look pretty good, and they don\\'t even have Sandberg back yet.  \\n\\nCUBS IN \\'93!!!!!I finally got it back, with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\n#2\\tROB ZETTLER\\t\\tSeason:\\t4th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tC/C-\\n\\nZettler gave the Sharks every bit he\\'s got this year; unfortunately, this still\\nwasn\\'t enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer, if that.  He works\\nhard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to\\ncostly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an\\noffensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed\\nto make the team next year.\\n\\n#3\\tDAVID WILLIAMS\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, free agent from New Jersey\\nGrade:\\t\\tC/C-\\n\\nIMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in \\'91-92,\\nplaying a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and\\ngood defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,\\nwas good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that\\n\\'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he\\nwas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the\\nplaymaking skills that made him the team\\'s leading scorer among defensemen last\\nyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.\\n\\n#4\\tJAYSON MORE\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB+\\n\\nAfter being touted as the team\\'s top defensive prospects in training camp\\nbefore \\'91-92, More had a rather disappointing \\'91-92, as he was not\\nparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,\\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team\\'s most\\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\\n\\n#5\\tNEIL WILKINSON\\t\\tSeason: 4th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB-\\n\\nWilkinson was probably the team\\'s top defensive defenseman in \\'91-92.  However,\\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\\n\\n#6\\tSANDIS OZOLINSH\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A)\\n\\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team\\'s MVP.  A serious knee injury\\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\\nbut he still finished as the team\\'s top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh\\'s abilities.  At the time, he\\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\\nsusceptible to so-called \"rookie mistakes,\" but was probably the defenseman who\\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back\\nfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.\\n\\n#19\\tDOUG ZMOLEK\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB\\n\\nZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks\\nto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but\\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn\\'t show it (15 points).\\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to\\nbecome a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and\\ndefensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\\n\\nDoes anyone know if there will be alternate games in cities where local\\nbroadcast rights are being protected?

What the heck are women doing\\neven THINKING of getting into baseball.  They cause so many problems.  Just\\nlook at Lisa Olson.  Remember that feisty reporter that entered the New\\nEngland Patriots locker room?  She started crying like a LITTLE GIRL!  I\\njust don\\'t think women belong in a man\\'s sport.  Before you smart guys\\nflame me for this, I know the given example was about football.  Who cares?\\n It still applies to other MALE sports.  How can we have women umpires? \\nJeez!  Look at Pam Postema.  Just because she\\'s a woman, everybody on the\\nface of the earth thinks it\\'s great that she\\'s getting an opportunity to\\nump.  If you even watched the games and had an IQ greater than that of\\nroast beef, you\\'d see that she is not nearly as good as most AAA umpires.\\nBesides, she is probably more worried about cracking a fingernail with a\\nfoul tip off of Wade Boggs\\' bat. Or Jose Oquendo\\'s bat. Either way, there\\nare too many complications.\\n\\n\\nCool.  They sound like a cult classic.  Can someone post a address or\\nphone # of a store that sells these?\\n\\nThanks,\\nI\\'d be willing to make two wagers:\\n1) Snow doesn\\'t win ROY.\\n2) Mattingly is out of baseball within five years.\\n\\nI\\'m skeptical of the first, because I don\\'t think Snow is that good a\\nplayer, and he is on a losing team.\\n\\nI\\'m skeptical of the second because of his back.  Mattingly is 32 this\\nyear, and how many players play until they are 40?  Not too many, and\\nmost of them didn\\'t have chronic back problems when they were 32.\\n\\nCould be wrong on either or both, but I think that\\'s the smart way to\\nbet...\\nwhy?Hello All,\\n\\nI\\'d like to learn how to keep score when I watch ball\\ngames using official scoring methods. Where can I get\\nscoresheets and instructions on how to use them?\\n\\nI appreciate it,\\n\\nMike\\nYes, a point well-taken ... however, even in areas that finally got\\nsome games, there\\'s something nagging in the back of your skull when\\nthe network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its\\nsports news, \"There\\'s an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City,\\nand we\\'ll *try* to get you an update through the show ...\" when you\\nknow that it\\'s on a satellite\\'s feedhorn somewhere up there ...\\n\\n\\nFrom today\\'s Times, ABC got great ratings in Chicago and St. Louis (a\\n4.2), and the Kings-Flames got a 2.9 on the West Coast, but only a 2.2\\nin metro New York (i.e., the Devils squandered their newfound support\\nfrom a year ago when they played the Rangers )-;).  In comparison,\\nSeniors Golf did better ...\\n\\n\\nI fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great ...\\nI can\\'t tell if ABC did any advance marketing or not, \\'cos I don\\'t\\nwatch much TV ... the NHL should have made sure that it was solid\\non cable before going on the air.  Even ESPN could\\'ve sold second\\nrights to third party systems (i.e., non-SportsChannel) since they\\nare not making any extra money by sitting on the games ... hockey\\nfans will not necessarily be watching pre-season beach volleyball\\nif playoffs games aren\\'t being shown somewhere ...\\n\\ngldWell put, Jason.  I am not from Wisconsin, but I have close relatives who\\nlive in Port Washington (about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee), I visit the\\ncity regularly, and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals\\nplay  and the NCAA Hockey Championships.  It is a beautiful building.  The\\nPettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in\\nNorth America.\\nAs to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a\\nfranchise, word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown\\nCounty Arena.\\nOnce again, the Admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of\\nMilwaukee have been supporting them well.  The games I have been to have seen\\ncrowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000, which are numbers some NHL teams (i.e.\\nthe Islanders, Hartford, New Jersey) would be envious of having on some nights.\\nPlus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without\\nthe glamour of having an NHL club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount\\nof hockey interest exists in the city.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMartin Hill, Rt. 2, Box 155B, Sault Ste.

Hopefully he will provide another\\nstellar performance and earn the name Robb \"Stopper\" Stauber.\\n\\n\\nI believe this is how they are...I know it is Gretzky and Sandstrom, but he\\nhas been putting a number of people on left.  Also the Carson, Robataille\\nKurri line once ignited, will light the fire of the other lines.\\n(Hopefully!)\\n\\nIt is evident that the scoring drought is getting to Luc, after his slight\\nbreakaway in the third (I think) he was steamed on the bench, this emotion\\nmight help him break his streak.  Also, I have noticed Blake has had a few\\nreally good chances to score, but has fanned, or shot wide.  Is the injury\\nstill affecting him?  \\n\\n\\nThe E\\n    D\\n    G\\n    E  Steve Tuttle was traded from the Blues to TB in the before the start of this\\nseason along with Pat Jablonski, for future considerations. He played for\\nMilwaukee of the IHL, then got traded from TB to QUE along with Michel Mongeau.\\nHe\\'s currently playing with Halifax of the AHL.[argument over \"reasonable\" players and umpires deleted]\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, but the baseball rules say you can only appeal a ball and not a\\nstrike. There was no decision made by the umpire regarding an appeal.\\nOnce he called it a strike the call could not be changed.  \\n\\nI thought that the umpire did the right thing.\\n\\nof  \\nWhy  \\n\\n} How does one read the betting spreads for baseball?  They tend to be something\\n} like 8-9 which means it must not be runs!\\n\\nthat spread means you bet $5 on the underdog to win $8, or $9 on the\\nfavorite to win $5.To all the Braves doubters:\\n\\nDon\\'t worry.  The bats will come alive, and the Braves will come around.\\nThe pitching is solid, and as long the Braves don\\'t have serious injuries\\nto the starting rotation, they\\'ll continue to pitch well.  Heck, with\\nthe five starters on the Braves rotation, they could even sustain an\\ninjury to one of the five (I hope this doesn\\'t happen, though).\\n\\nThe bats are there... Pendleton will certainly bat over .280, Justice\\nis catching fire, Bream, Nixon, Sanders, Gant... well, there\\'s too\\nmuch offense there to be kept quiet for much longer.  Right now, the\\nCleveland Indians have 7 players batting over .300!  But I certainly\\nwouldn\\'t their seven for our respective seven (though wouldn\\'t the\\nBraves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting\\nover .300?).\\n\\nThe bullpen... well, it IS suspect.  But when the bats come alive, the\\nguys in the bullpen will be of less concern.\\n\\nSo anyway, I believe the Braves will be tough to beat this season.  I\\'m\\nnot saying the Braves have automatically won the division, but I\\'m optim-\\nistic about their season (though it\\'s awful painful to watch them at\\ntimes right now).\\n\\nGo Braves!!!Have you ever noticed that after a hockey player has been interviewed\\nin between periods on a tv game. That they usually get a goal or\\nan assist. can you explain this or is it that they usually talk \\nto stars more than regular players which explains the hight \\npercentage of results after.\\n\\nJust wondering how everybody else thinks about this or if they dont \\ncare about this trivial nonsense.\\nttyl  Tom\\n\\n\\n\\nI disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the\\ncrowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-\\nistically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they\\nstill go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the\\ngame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the\\nNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is \\nbringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are\\ntrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect \\nexamples of players that real fans know aren\\'t worth a damn and yet, being\\nbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals\\nthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to\\nattract, that these players are indeed superstars.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt ain\\'t nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn\\'t think about much \\nat all.  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes that\\nMcDonalds makes good hamburgers?\\n \\n\\nYes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi-\\nbilities has he?  He was hyped, initially, as a superstar, but outside of\\none Grey Cup game he has done very little to maintain/enhance that assess-\\nment of his talents.  Most Argo fans probably feel the team would be better\\noff without him. \\n\\ncordially, as always,\\n\\nrm\\nPATRICK\\n1st rd:\\tPens over Isles in 4.\\n\\tDevils over Caps in 6.\\n2nd:\\tPens over Devils in 7.\\n\\nADAMS\\n1st rd: B\\'s over Sabres in 5.\\n\\tNords over Habs in 5.\\n2nd:\\tB\\'s over Nords in 6.\\n\\nNORRIS\\n1st:\\tHawks over Stars/Blues in 5.\\n\\tWings over Leafs in 7.\\n2nd:\\tHawks over Wings in 5.\\n\\nSMYTHE\\n1st:\\tJets over Canucks in 7.\\t(call it a hunch)\\n\\tFlames over Kings in 5.\\n2nd:\\tJets over Flames in 6.\\n\\nWALES\\nPens over B\\'s in 7.\\t\\n\\nCAMPBELL\\nHawks over Jets in 5.\\n\\nSTANLEY\\nPens over Hawks in 5.\\n  But maybe his wife was :-) \\n\\n  I don\\'t claim to know whether it\\'s true or not, but a couple different\\npeople (totally unrelated) have said Harry was \\'relieved\\' of his duties\\nbecause he had more than platonic relations with Augie Busch\\'s wife.\\nJudgement is left to the individual, cuz I sure don\\'t claim to be an\\nimpeachable source in this case. \\nAs I\\'ve mentioned in the rules posting, I will be out of town until the\\nday before the entry deadline, so I won\\'t be able to respond to your\\nmessages until April 18.\\n\\nI would be grateful if someone could repost the rules and instructions for\\nthe playoff pool sometime next week, for the benefit of those who missed the\\nfirst two postings.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\n-- \\nAndrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com\\nHP IDACOM Telecom Operation     | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253\\n\\nThere are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the\\nfans.  I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties\\nmore than names honouring personages.  And of course, they would not appear\\nnearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.  \\nAnother thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages, as used in\\nthe other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at the\\nNHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to\\naccount for games in hand (which is almost always the case).

Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn\\'t hit a lick, had\\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don\\'t \\nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn\\'t field,\\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\\nOBP wasn\\'t THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \\n\\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80\\'s.  I know that\\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn\\'t overrated by the media.  \\n\\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one\\'s actually pretty close.  He\\'s had a s\\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \\n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I\\'d have to take a closer look at the stats (it\\'s been \\na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \\n\\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn\\'t mean a whole hell of a lot if you \\nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \\nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \\nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\\n\\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF\\'er.\\n\\n\\n\\tLemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN\\'T marginal?\\n\\n\\n\\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he\\'s won something along\\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \\ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie\\'s more\\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\\n80\\'s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie\\'s\\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power (\\'cept against Tom Niedenfuer\\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\\n\\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\\nstiff.  His \\'82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\\nSS numbers go.  He\\'s a clear HOF\\'er, IMHO.\\n\\n\\n\\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you\\'re right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \\ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn\\'t be in the HOF.\\n\\tSkyJack?  I\\'ve said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\\nabout Morris\\' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris\\' \"ability\\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in \\'93, he may be damned \\nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\\n80\\'s for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\\nnot favorites.  Morris\\' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\\n\"consideration\".  \\n\\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \\nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he\\'s \\njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\\n(Of course, Nolan\\'s a HOF\\'er...)\\n\\tPuck?  Probably, although he\\'s got to play reasonably well for a few\\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren\\'t enough to make the HOF, most\\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \\ntragic or sudden).  He\\'s very popular in the media and with fans, and\\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF\\'s in the game since he joined the\\nleague.  I\\'ve always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it\\'s too early to sell.\\n\\n\\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \\nor not, I never tire of it.  It\\'s an interesting subject.  Here\\'s an off\\nthe top of my head list of potential HOF\\'ers from each team.  I probably\\nleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

Did you say that?  Wow, I can\\'t believe that\\nanyone would think that the Braves (or any other team, for that matter)\\nshould get the title for free.  What a dolt that person would be, if\\nthat was what they thought.  Incredible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Hey, we could start a new game on the net.  It\\'s called \\'Where\\'s Roger?\\'\\nIt\\'s similiar to \\'Where\\'s Waldo?\\' but instead of finding Waldo in a picture\\nof people, we try to find Roger in a newsgroup on the net.\\n I predict that he\\'ll be in r.s.basketball.pro next.\\n \\n Today, Frank Viola and rest of pitcher staff of Boston Red Sox shutout Chicago\\nWhite Sox 4-0.  It is Red Sox 9th win of this season.Can someone in this net post a Yankee Schedule?\\nI need this right away.\\n\\nWell, I could become a fan ... (-;\\n\\nSeriously, this news coming since Thursday has effectively robbed the\\nIslanders and the Devils of any airtime on sports talk shows almost\\neverywhere that I\\'ve sampled ... in fact, the playoffs almost don\\'t\\nexist now. )-; Ranger fans calling in to WFAN or to New York One\\'s\\nmidnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near-\\norgasm over Keenan\\'s hiring.  (Summarizing: Keenan is a winner and\\nwill give the Broadway Bums \\'da business\\' in pursuing the next Cup\\nchase ...)\\n\\n\\nThis will be an interesting combination to watch ... Keenan has been\\npaid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach, but his\\nadvice on any player moves will be listened to closely.  A lot of big\\nplayer moves will happen --- remember that Keenan got rid of Denis\\nSavard.  The country club days are over ...\\n\\n\\nIf Paramount had given Smith an earlier sign of support and offered\\nKeenan the big money to put-up-and-shut-up back in January, the\\nRangers might not be heading for golf now ...\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of Keenan\\'s first statements was a reaffirmation that Mark Messier\\nwill be the team\\'s captain.\\n\\n\\nBy then, Smith might have some bargains on Keenan\\'s advice ... like\\nmaybe unloading Phil Bourque for Tie Domi ... (-;\\n\\ngldI heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati. This would\\nhelp so that the O\\'s could make some real free agent signings in the \\noffseason. Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right\\nnow. The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent\\nalthough I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming\\nup faster in the O\\'s hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike\\nFlanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by\\ncoaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came\\nin the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This\\nmay be Ben\\'s year. \\n\\tI feel that while this may not be Mussina\\'s Cy Young year, he will\\nbe able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year\\naround August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O\\'s need.\\nOrsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense\\nbetter and play like he did in \\'91. The O\\'s right now don\\'t have many\\nleft-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal\\'s return\\nto his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The \\nrotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an\\ninteresting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get\\nthree pop outs? You never know.\\nThe way I see the AL East this year (with personal biases mixed in)\\nBaltimore\\nNew York\\nToronto\\nMilwaukee\\nCleveland\\nBoston\\nDetroit\\n(The top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind. One of these 4 will\\ndefinitely win the division unless it snows in Hell/Maryland :). I feel\\nthat this Baltimore\\'s season to finally put everything together.)\\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n \\n\\n\\tNice sig. Like the change. \\n\\tBTW: Could you post the names of the people who are going to be on the\\nletter? I (and I\\'m sure others) would like to know if we are included. If I\\'m\\nnot I want to be! Roger is a fool!\\n\\n\\tThe Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their\\nquest for more left-handed pitching.  So far, no takers.\\nPersonally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he\\nhas also led the team in past years for hitting into double\\nplays, or at least been among the leaders.\\n \\nSharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play\\nevery day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just\\none base every day, say third, he\\'d also improve defensively.\\n \\nWallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed.\\nThe improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an\\neffect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez\\nwere bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.\\nMartinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might\\nhave seen him lifted in the third in past years.\\n \\nAstacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.\\nThe Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls\\nin the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great\\non defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to\\nsteal and has at least one pick off at first.\\n \\nWallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on\\ndefense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers\\nsome runs.  But I don\\'t think he is as bad as his current average.\\nI suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw\\nseem to have come out of theirs.\\nYeah... I think that the Flames and the Flyers traded Captains once... Mel  \\nBridgeman for Brad Marsh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tWhat\\'s the difference between Nolan Ryan and Yount?  Both have hung\\naround for years, and continue to post great stats.  Why shouldn\\'t Dave Kingman\\nget into the Hall?  Or Murray, Evens, Reardon, and others?  What the hell do\\nyou have to do?  Ask an opposing pitcher whether he thinks that Winfield should\\nbe in the hall...  God.  Pretty soon you\\'ll be saying that Cal Ripken doesn\\'t\\ndeserve to be in the Hall.  Then, I\\'ll flame you. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoSox 3     Royals 1\\n\\nWP: Clemens (1-0)\\nLP: Appier  (0-1)\\n\\nPunch Imlach\\'s contributions as a coach and GM were far greater than\\nthose of the above combined.  Should we name a division or trophy after\\nhim?  Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they\\nwere powerful owners.  As owners they certainly did help to build the\\nleague but whether they developed the game is another question altogether.\\nAre we going to honour those who contributed to the league\\'s evolution\\nor are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the \\nsport itself?   \\n\\n\\nI can\\'t disagree with you here.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat have you heard?  The Major was the *definitive* little asshole!  He\\noriginated the phrase \"if you can\\'t beat \\'em in the alley you can\\'t beat\\n\\'em on the ice.\"  That was his idea of hockey.  Do you think, by chance,\\nthat Don Cherry is a classy individual?\\n\\n\\nThe money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on, and\\nthat is: \"it is the players that are what make the game great and not the\\npeople who put them on the ice\"\\n\\nExactly true.  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch\\nis the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame.  I have\\nalways thought that this was nonsense.\\n\\n\\n-- Does anyone know if MSG will televise any of the Binghampton Rangers playoff\\ngames.  Even taped replays would be nice?\\n\\n\\n\\nPlayer       Team   GP  G   A  Pts +/- PIM\\n\\n    M.Lemieux    PIT     3   4   2   6   2   0\\n    Francis      PIT     3   1   5   6   5   4\\n    Oates

The only person\\nleft to bat 4th is Williams.\\n\\n\\nGood question.  It\\'s my impression, not backed by evidence, that general\\nsouth-of-the-borderness seems to exempt one from the hiring-firing effect\\nI was talking about.  \\n\\nBack in the 20\\'s there were some attempts to hire black Cuban ballplayers; \\nthey were rejected by the commissioner and others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, what *did* I mean to say?  Aside from some short-lived exceptions\\nsuch as Japanese internment in WW II, only blacks were affected by laws\\nregarding: slavery, Jim Crow, miscegenation, military service, etc.  If\\nmy claim of exclusivity is not 100% airtight, that is, if you can come\\nup with this or that exception, fine -- have a cookie.  But compared to\\nthis list, no other racial group put up with a legal onslaught worth\\ndiscussing at length.Only if you persist in believing that Peter Gammons is more knowledgable about\\nbaseball than the average mailbox.  Okay, I\\'m overstating.  Still, the man \\nactually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the NL this\\nyear did not pitch in the majors last year.\\n\\nHuh?\\n\\nIMO, this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the \\nother expansion drafts had, since the talent was diluted over both leagues.\\nIn Gammons\\' defense, because the talent drain came from the AL as well, some\\nincrease will be seen.  He also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump\\nin offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season.  He\\'s still\\nfull of it...\\n\\n\\n\\tNo way -- gotta be Walter Johnson.  All were with Washington.\\nCarlton spent too long in St. Louis to collect less than 700 there.\\n\\n\\n\\tI\\'d also guess Hough due to his length of tenure though I suspect \\nBobby Witt wasn\\'t far behind.  Maybe even Jenkins snuck in close....\\n\\n\\n\\tFingers had to have achieved 100 with either MIL or with SD so, yes,\\nI\\'d go with that guess.  Otherwise I was thinking that Reardon has a better\\nchance of having 100 with MIN along with (I would think) easily reaching 100 \\nwith MON.\\n\\n\\n\\tGotta be Willie Mays...I am fairly sure he had over 300 steals in his\\ncareer.\\n\\n\\n\\tHmmm...Leary is a really good point.  I\\'d forgotten about him.  Well,\\nif nothing else, there are plenty of ex-Met pitchers in the category of\\n\"could have lost to all teams\" -- Koosman, Leary, Torrez, Ryan, Seaver....\\nI guess the best three guesses would be Leary, Ryan, and either Seaver or\\nKoosman.\\n\\n\\nduh, why not just chop out the .sig?\\n\\nbob vesterman.\\n\\nps: hey kids, take all those pictures of dead presidents out of your\\nparents\\' wallets and mail them to:How does one read the betting spreads for baseball?

I think Barrasso and Joseph should be the two strongest candidates\\nthis year.  I don\\'t believe ALL of the hype that Roy, Belfour and now Potvin\\nreceive for their goaltending.  I do think that they are great in the nets,\\nbut I would rather have Curtis, Tommy or Fuhr in the nets during this years\\nplayoffs.  The big name tenders always seem to have a strong defense in front\\nof them and the goaltenders get the most credit.  I would rather face 25 shots\\na game, than have to rely on Joseph saving 35, but if the goalie is going to\\nface 35 shots, I would rather have Joseph or Barrasso facing them.\\n\\n-Jay\\n\\nps Go Quebec!!!  And I know that McLean and several others should be mentioned\\nas candidates for this years Vezina, but I am partial to Joseph and Barrasso\\nthis season.\\n\\nLou wanted Morris all along.  The idiot.  Giving the man $40 million\\nto play with is like giving a five year old a loaded Uzi with the\\nsafety off.  The only question is how many shots he will get off\\nbefore somebody is wise enough to take it away.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t see why people expect Boston to finish sixth.  The bottom four\\nteams last year were essentially tied.  Boston, in seventh place, had\\n73 wins.  The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins.\\n\\nNow I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than\\nthe Indians or Tigers.  Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year\\nat 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (so\\nfar, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they\\nshouldn\\'t win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and\\nthe Tigers *still* have no pitching.  They will win some 20-3\\nblowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too.\\n\\n*MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly, win 78 games, and finish fifth.\\nBut I think third or fourth place is more likely.Here are the final point totals for players chosen in the USENET Hockey Draft.\\nNote that only 114 players scored more than 55 points (the minimum cost)\\nalthough 254 different players were

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\\n\\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the\\n   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you\\n   are thrown out of the game, and fined.\\n\\n3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\\n\\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in\\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\\n\\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\\nthe PA announcer says it.\\n\\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \\nchance of pronouncing his name right.\\n\\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the \\'Laker Girls\\' get to do their \\nroutines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods\\neither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The\\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\\n\\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch\\nit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then\\nit truly is a sad day.\\n\\nEnough for now.The r.s.h FAQ sheet never fails to crash my newsreader.  The only way I\\ncan avoid crashing (and restarting the machine) is to look at the headers and\\navoid reading the FAQ.  Does anyone else have problems reading the FAQ?\\n\\nI was at a Cincinnati Cyclones game a year ago when the local country\\nstation sponsored a kazoo giveaway.  After a particularly bad call by the\\nunderexperienced ECHL ref, it was Kazoostorm time down on the ice.  I\\nthought this was a pathetic display by the fans, but they were rightfully\\nunhappy.\\n\\nActually, for the Padres this year so far it\\'s 23%.  They are 5th in\\nthe league in HRs, and ALL have been solo shots.\\n\\nPythagorean projection puts them at .360 winning percentage\\nor 58-104.  Need some pitching help, fast!\\n\\nGood news, though, is that Hurst has been throwing curveballs\\nw/o any pain.  Threw 80 pitches yesterday.  Should be back\\nin a couple of weeks.  Maybe we can trade him to the Yankees\\nfor Militello.\\n\\nDaveDuring the first three games of the Pens-Devils series, I have been\\nimpressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens.  Jagr,\\nMacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch.  But, one\\nelement of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman.\\n\\nDespite Brooks\\' lunatic comments, and despite the Devils\\' line changing\\nadantage in last night\\'s game, Bowman has been able to keep his cool and\\nkeep the Devils in the dark.  Granted, the hell-dwellers had the Pens\\nbottled up for a while last night, but Bowman was eventually able to\\nconfigure his line-up to get the job done.  His ability to throw out new\\nlooks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible.\\n\\nBowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an\\nindividual basis.  Last night, for instance, he realized that the speed\\nof Jagr, Straka, and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance.  As\\na result, Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr played\\nalmost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and MacEachern\\nscored a goal, while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night.\\nHis ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is\\ncommendable, especially when a coach of such a talented team might\\nsimply rely on the overall talent to dominate, and to bring about\\nsuccess.Pitchers are required to pitch (or feint or attempt a pick-off)\\nwithin 20 seconds after receiving the ball, not 15.\\n\\nPitchers are required to pitch their warm-up throws within a\\none minute time frame, beginning after each half inning ends,\\nnot two minutes.\\n\\nAnd the reason why a reliever should be allowed warm-ups is\\nsimple: Different mound, different catcher.\\n\\nRyan Robbins\\nPenobscot Hall\\nUniversity of Maine    Only if you are in the eastern time zone - pacific will get the \\n    Kings vs Calgary \\n\\n\\nHey American Hockey fans,\\n\\nAs a hockey fan I can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel.  The\\nproblem is that other Americans don\\'t give a shit about hockey.  They view\\nit as a bunch of Canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the\\nshit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in\\ntwo-thirds of the US to see the stuff naturally.  On the other hand\\nBASEBALL is the *gasp**swoon**sigh* \"NATIONAL PASTTIME\".  BASEBALL is so\\nromanticized in the US that you are supposed to forget that other sport\\nexist after April 1 and before November 1.  I feel that since ESPN shows 5+\\nBASEBALL games a week they should be able to show an OT hockey game instead\\nof the opening innings of a BASEBALL game.  Hell, the game is going to last\\n2hrs 45mins, so what if you miss the first 1 1/2 hrs?  And I am an Indians\\nfan!  Show the end of what you started, then switch!  But then, I\\'m a\\nhockey fan, what do I know?  BASEBALL is the all mighty sport.Buffalo is up 2-0 is the series with Boston, and the reason....Grant Fuhr ?\\n  Fuhr is playoff hungry, and he\\'s proving once again why they call him\\n  money goaltender. Fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the\\n  league anymore (Statistically at least), but he\\'s proving that he can\\n  make the big save at the right time.\\n  \\n  The Leafs should have kept Fuhr, and probably would have had a chance \\n  against powerhouse Detroit. But again.......where was Andreychoke in game 1 ?\\n\\n  I can see the huge smile on Gerald\\'s face after Fuhr\\'s performance.Like many others I too was watching the Caps/Isles game when the went\\nto the baseball game.  I too was pissed.  How could they interupt such\\nan important game.  I understand about contracts, but you would think they\\nwould have a clause in the contract concerning important games!\\nAnyway,  us BLUES (and Hawks) fans got shafted worse!  While everyone\\nin the U.S. and watched the game on ABC.  However those of us who live in\\nthe central Illinois area were subjected to watching the Arthritus(?)\\nTelethon.  The area that was most affected by the telecast did not get\\nto see the game except through HAWK VISION.  This game, had it been\\ntelevised, would have been the first home Hawks game shown in the area\\nsince 1980.  This television BULL*&%$ has got to stop.  We are not only\\nbeing deprived of seeing games, due to skyrocketing ticket prices, but\\nwe are also being deprived of watching them on TV.\\n PEACE,\\n HAMMER\\n \\n\\nThese new rule changes are great!  However, I think that your rules are\\nMUCH too complicated.  How will the normal average fan be able to count\\nhow many fouls a player has?  And then we would even have to remember the\\nnames of the players, in order to determine who drew the foul!  And, of\\ncourse, there will have to be new \"sub-positions\", like the power center\\nwho just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him,\\nand the \"shooting defenseman\" and the \"point defenseman\".  Finally, we\\'ll\\nbe able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers. \\nSince almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled, we\\'ll be able to\\nsee Ulf Samuellson (sp?) and Tie Domi miss penalty shots like crazy.  \\n\\n;-) ;-) ;-)\\n\\n--\\n    Keith Keller\\t\\t\\t\\tLET\\'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLET\\'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\\n\\tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\\t\\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!\\n\\n[stuff deleted...]\\n\\n  \\nAs I recall, the author of the _original_ article that started the thread\\nclaimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons. \\nRoger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his\\nwas a \"jingoistic rant\", but you also supported the name-changing on the\\ngrounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals\\nthey represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I \\nthink you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an \\nobservation...\\n\\nHowever, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of\\nchanging the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for\\nthe \\'casual fan\\'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names\\nbased on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a nice\\nand unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not\\nthink that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of\\npeople that are interested in hockey, so it\\'s a pointless exercise anyway.\\n\\nIf the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not \\ncentral to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is\\nwhether or not players like Orr who \\'contributed to the glory of the sport\\'\\nwould have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to\\nplay in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to\\nbuilders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question.

Speaking of Chelios, I \\nwonder if Serge Savard feels like a moron for making that trade.\\nI also wish we still had Corson.\\n\\nRob Ramage on the ice is less useful than a Gatorade bottle on the \\nbench.\\n\\nVincent Damphousse has decided to take a vacation, apparently.  I have\\nno idea why Demers is playing Denis Savard on the checking line with\\nCarbonneau.  Savard is skating well, and is one of the only dangerous\\nCanadiens in Quebec\\'s zone with the puck.  Too bad nobody is in front\\nmost of the time.\\n\\nDo you also notice that in the defensive zone, not a single Nordique\\ngets knocked down?  It\\'s disgusting.  We also have Lebeau (5\\'10\", 172)\\ngetting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn (6\\'3\", 205) with no reply\\nfrom the team, except to yell for a penalty.  Dammit, Denis Savard \\nthrew the best (only?) Montreal hit of the night when he knocked\\nSundin off-balance.  When Denis Savard is your team\\'s enforcer, there\\'s\\nbig trouble someplace...\\n\\n\\nAside from that second goal, Roy did stand on his head.  The third \\nperiod at least provided something to look forward to.  Habs won the\\nperiod, IMO, and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a\\ncouple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game\\nhad started at 7:30.  Hopefully they play that way at home.  Roy made \\nthe saves (we\\'ll ignore that second goal), so now it\\'s up to the team.\\n\\n\\n--\\ndchhabra@stpl.ists.ca\\nLast year my nine year old son fell in love with baseball and now\\nlikes to play and to follow the professionals.

rules for goalies\\' equipment changed? It seems that e.g. glove\\nhas become bigger and bigger all the time (and pads too), and the goalies are\\nwearing \"over size\" jerseys. Am I dreaming? If you watch old photos or\\nfilms let say about ten years back, I think the difference is quite obvious.\\nWho is an expert on this, please let me know. (Or have the goalies become\\nbigger?)How about Brooks Robinson\\'s last homerun ever?  #268 came on 4-19-77 at\\nMemorial Stadium with one out and two on in the bottom of the 10th inning.\\nLarry Harlow was due up, but Brooks pinch-hit a 3-2 pitch from Dave LaRoche\\ninto the left field bleachers for a 6-5 win.Did anyone happen to see Peter Gammons on ESPN last night?  He addressed\\nthis exact issue, and dismissed it rather quickly.  According to Gammons,\\nadvanced scouts are reporting that Morris\\' fastball and slider still have\\nthe same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability\\nto keep the ball hidden during his release.  Guzman and Stottlemyre have\\ngone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a\\nlittle work with the pitching coach.  Gammons looks to see Morris back in\\ntop form within the month.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, still have my doubts.  Morris\\' ERA last year was\\nrather high for a pitcher who won 20 games.  His showing in the Series was\\nnot surprising.  Although I\\'m not convinced that he\\'s washed up, I have my\\ndoubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the\\nTwins in \\'91.\\nMight? You\\'d have to have no sense of humor at all not to! My favorite\\nstuff are the Zero Heros, players who haven\\'t hit homers in a long time, \\nthe LGTGAH (who is that named after, I can\\'t remember), and the box score\\nline of the week. Incidentally, I just found out that the column has been\\nmoved to Sundays. I get my Dad to send it to me up here in Boston every \\nweek. Great stuff!\\nI re-read what I wrote and it didn\\'t say exactly what I thought.  \\n\\nSure the Pens are a better team.  They\\'ve got size and the best skill players\\nin the league.  They\\'ve also got the best clutch goaltending.  They\\'re the \\nbest team in the league.\\n\\nBut, my point was the Caps have not played to their ability level vs the\\nPens since last year\\'s choke.  And that\\'s the mental problem (the one they\\'ve\\nhad for a number of years) I tried to point out.  Spirit, mental preparedness,\\nwill to win, whatever you want to call it, it\\'s missing when the Caps play the\\nPens.  Actually, you\\'re right - it won\\'t make any difference.\\nMaybe it\\'s just me, but the combination of those *young* faces peeking out\\nfrom under oversized aqua helmets screams \"Little League\" in every fibre of\\nmy being...\\nGiants Win the Pennant!!  Giants Win the Pennant !! Gi... OOOPS\\nI guess I\\'m a little early here...\\nSee you in October...\\n\\n325/441/577.\\n\\n\\nI *loved* Dan Kelly!  He was on USA when I first got hooked on Hockey back\\nin 1980 or so.  No, he wasn\\'t always spot on top of the play, and he\\nwasn\\'t overly cute, but those pipes!  That lusty, barrel chested, voice!\\nNo pipsqueak was he (unlike some fellas we know!)\\n\\nI rode into hockey mania on the coattails of Gretzky and the Boys on the\\nBus.  My first Finals saw the Islanders sweep them.  But I\\'ll never\\nforget the night, a year later, when the Oilers closed it out at home in\\nthe pandemonium, the smoke from a million sparklers, the long empty-net\\ngoal near the end, and Dan Kelly letting the crowd\\'s reaction tell the\\nstory for a few long seconds, then that voice barking through the din\\n\"Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton!\"  It sounds stupid, but that\\nearly (for me) hockey memory will always bring a thrill.  Since then\\nI\\'ve grown a lot more jaded about the game, but I was really saddened\\nby Dan Kelly\\'s passing.  He was one of the good guys.\\n\\n\\n Hmmm...what about walks and SB? Baerga got clobbered by Alomar in OBP and\\nbeat him in SLG by a lesser margin. Even putting aside any other factors,\\na player with a 51 point edge in OBP is more productive than a player with\\na 28 point edge in SLG. The issue has been studied before, and I doubt you\\ncould come up with any convincing argument the other way.\\n People see the batting average and the HR, but they don\\'t really know  \\ntheir value is worth unless they\\'ve studied the issue closely. The fact is that\\nBaerga ate up a LOT more outs than Alomar; while Baerga was making outs,\\nAlomar was drawing walks and being on base for Carter, Winfield et.al.\\nAwesome home record or not, you need to remember the 7th game last year at the\\nAud.  I\\'d like to see some playoff games since I\\'m stuck in Buffalo at UB, but\\nI think Boston isn\\'t giving up so easy.\\n\\nyet.\\n\\nI\\'m not bored either.  Most people I know say that winning the second Cup\\nwas better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one.\\nBut I\\'m every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm\\nto which Susan originally referred.  Inner calm is not boredom.\\n\\nAs far as the arena in general being boring, well Richard\\'s got that right.\\nIt\\'s been that way all season.  I attribute it to a lot of new fans who\\njust don\\'t have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans.  At\\nlast Tuesday\\'s game, I overheard a man express surprise that a\\ngoaltender can get an\\nassist.\\n\\nAnyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen\\nat any time.  I\\'m confident in the Pens but I\\'m also not stupid enough to\\nthink for one minute that it\\'s impossible for New Jersey to blow them out\\nof this series.  I doubt that will happen but it\\'s possible.  Bored?  Uh-uh.\\nSpoiled?  Not in the least.  Forgot what excitement is like?  Living through\\nthat amazing streak wasn\\'t exciting?!  I don\\'t take a darned thing for\\ngranted.  God, look at Chicago...\\n\\nAnd I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway.

You also forgot that you can\\'t get an RBI (barring a HR) with\\nnobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?\\n\\nMost runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the\\nbatter did something good.  I use the phrase \"happened to be\" advisedly.\\nLots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the\\nmost ability to \"turn it up a notch\" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and\\nwhat they\\'ve found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an\\nability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.  People who\\ntend to do things that *would* cause an RBI if there were somebody on base\\nend up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by\\nbeing in position.  \\n\\n\\nI agree.\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrently, he\\'s all over.  He played 2nd when Deshields was out.  He was\\nshifted to third when Delino came back.

Remove the Balk rule.  It is the runners responsibility to stay \"safe\"\\n      no matter what the pitcher does.\\n\\n   2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)\\n      without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base\\n      as if walked.\\n\\nThis last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases\\nconsiderably.  Suppose the pitcher uses up (N-1) of his N pick-off\\nattempts.  The runner can probably stretch his lead off the base,\\ngiven that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it\\nright this time.\\n\\nWould this suggestion apply to pick-off attempts per pitch, per\\nbatter, or per base runner (on the same base)?\\n\\n\\n--\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDr. Edward J.

Here\\'s the box score followed by\\na few things I did pick up:\\n\\nFirst Period:\\n\\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind\\'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\\nHar (interference) 18:43\\n\\nSecond Period:\\n\\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\\n\\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind\\'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\\n\\nThird Period:\\n\\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind\\'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\\n\\nOvertime:\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\\nPenalties - None\\n\\nPower Play:\\n\\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\\n\\nGoalies:\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\\n\\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\\n\\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\\n\\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\\n\\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\\nended up behind the goalie.\\n\\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don\\'t give them another chance. Carkner,\\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I\\'ll bet money at least one of\\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\\n\\nThat\\'s all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\\nwas that scored, much less how.\\n\\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I\\'m surprised\\nthat a former goalie wouldn\\'t look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \\nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\\nBut here\\'s the odd part. He couldn\\'t decide between Lindros and Recchi for\\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\\nhim and Lindros, doesn\\'t that make Lindros #2????\\n\\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\\n\\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\\nThe difference between the team\\'s record with him and without him is no\\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the \\'C\\' on his jersey\\nnext season.\\n\\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\\nand Tommy didn\\'t have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn\\'t\\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\\nhas a history of heart problems). There\\'s no question in my mind that Tommy\\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\\n\\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can\\'t argue with an all-time team high single season\\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn\\'t have a single player\\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\\nNot a tough choice.\\n\\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind\\'Amour topped his single season high point total\\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn\\'t on the top line\\nthis year and didn\\'t get as much playing time. Then again, he didn\\'t get the\\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\\n\\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\\nthat with his shot he\\'ll score a few more points next year without giving up\\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he\\'ll be the teams top defenseman\\nin years to come.\\n\\nGarry Galley was the team\\'s point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\\nthings you just can\\'t argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\\n\\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\\n\\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\\n\\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\\nIf you\\'re interested, you can send him mail at:\\n\\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\\n\\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in\\nnext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as\\nmany goals as they allowed, 319.\\n\\nThe 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.\\n\\nI will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey\\nNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have\\nno other way of getting them.\\n\\nI hope you\\'ve all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have.

I mean, it was the\\nFinnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous\\npenalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a\\nmatch penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and\\nseconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for \"delay of game\"\\nfor a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3\\nskating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans\\nwere starting to come up strong.\\nI am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.\\nIf you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not\\nable to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to\\nadmit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most\\nother countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the\\nOlympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish\\nspectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see\\nall this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best\\nteam/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team\\nlooses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to\\nadmit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team\\nto watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).\\nBut, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as\\nthese crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)\\nGermans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all\\nultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a\\ngreat danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience\\nmost of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as\\na big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can\\'t we\\njust look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers\\ncorresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all\\nAmericans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging\\naround beeing drunk on ferries...). \\nIn my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you\\ndon\\'t seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.\\n\\nThomas\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can you assume it was a sarcastic remark?[more about the Messier-Samuelsson incident]\\n I agree with Rick that Ulf\\'s cross check wasn\\'t illegal. It was the kind\\n of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called. Slo-mos\\n sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are.\\n Besides, if Messier can\\'t take the heat, he should stay out of the kitchen.\\n\\n Well Matt, Mattias Timmander hasn\\'t been playing with the MoDo elite league\\n team yet (just the MoDo junior team), so I predict he needs a few more years\\n here before he can join the B\\'s. I saw him play in the Swedish championship\\n game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game,\\n but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to\\n have a Ulf type-of-player on the B\\'s team too? :)\\n As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in\\n division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season,\\n and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is\\n considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is\\n Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play\\n in Elitserien next season, unless the B\\'s can get him of course.\\n I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to\\n watch in Swedish hockey this season.\\n\\n StaffanNHL PLAYOFF RESULTS FOR 4/22/93.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                  CONFERENCE SEMI-FINALS        BEST OF SEVEN\\n      PATRICK              ADAMS              NORRIS              SMYTHE\\n \\n NJ                  BUF   (leads 3-0)   STL   (leads 2-0)   WIN               \\n PIT   (leads 3-0)   BOS                 CHI                 VAN   (leads 2-0)\\n\\n NYI   (leads 2-1)   MON                 TOR                 LA    (tied  1-1) \\n WAS                 QUE   (leads 2-1)   DET   (leads 2-0)   CAL              \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nQuebec Nordiques    (leads series 2-1)    1   0   0   0   -   1\\nMontreal Canadiens                        0   1   0   1   -   2\\n\\n1st period: QUE, Sundin 1 - (Gusarov) 1:17\\n\\t \\n2nd period: MON, Muller 1 - (Damphousse, Bellows) (pp) 1:30\\n\\n3rd period: NONE\\n\\n1 Overtime: MON, Damphousse 1 - (Bellows, Desjardins) (pp) 10:30\\n\\nPowerplay Opportunities-Nordiques 0 of 4\\n\\t\\t\\tCanadiens 2 of 6\\n\\nShots on Goal-\\tNordiques  12   4  14   5  -  35\\n\\t\\tCanadiens  11  14  13  12  -  50\\n\\nQuebec Nordiques--Hextall (2-1) (50 shots - 48 saves)\\nMontreal Canadiens--Roy (1-2) (35 shots - 34 saves)\\n\\nATT-17,679\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPittsburgh Penguins  (leads series 3-0)   1   0   3   -   4\\nNew Jersey Devils                         1   1   1   -   3\\n\\n1st period: NJD, Guerin 1 - 1:03\\n\\t    PIT, McEachern 3 - (Straka) 9:36\\n\\t   \\n2nd period: NJD, Holik 1 - (S.Stevens) 16:32\\n\\n3rd period: PIT, M.Lemieux 4 - (Murphy, Ramsey) 1:07\\n\\t    PIT, Taglianetti 1 - (Loney, Tippett) 7:05\\n\\t    PIT, Murphy 1 - (Francis, Tocchet) (pp) 9:31\\n\\t    NJD, Semak 1 - (Zelepukin) 9:44\\n\\nPowerplay Opportunities-Penguins 1 of 4\\n\\t\\t\\tDevils   0 of 5\\n\\nShots on Goal-\\tPenguins   7  16  12  -  35\\n\\t\\tDevils    16  11   5  -  32\\n\\nPittsburgh Penguins--Barrasso (3-0) (32 shots - 29 saves)\\nNew Jersey Devils--Billington (0-1) (35 shots - 31 saves)\\n\\nATT-14,974\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBoston Bruins                        1   0   2   0   -   3\\nBuffalo Sabres  (leads series 3-0)   2   0   1   1   -   4\\n\\n1st period: BUF, Mogilny 4 - (LaFontaine, Hawerchuk) (pp) 1:33\\n\\t    BUF, Khmylev 1 - (Smehlik, Hannan) 4:42\\n\\t    BOS, Bourque 1 - (Oates, Donato) (pp) 17;33\\n\\n2nd period: NONE\\n\\n3rd period: BOS, Smolinski 1 - (Oates) 13:28\\n\\t    BUF, B.Sweeney 2 - (Khmylev, Carney) 14:56\\n\\t    BOS, Neely 3 - (Oates, Shaw) 15:57\\n\\n1 Overtime: BUF, Khmylev 2 - (Hawerchuk, LaFontaine) (pp) 1:05\\n\\nPowerplay Opportunities-Bruins 1 of 5\\n\\t\\t\\tSabres 2 of 7\\n\\nShots on Goal-\\tBruins  11   8  15   0  -  34\\n\\t\\tSabres  12  11   8   3  -  34\\n\\nBoston Bruins--Blue (0-1) (34 shots - 30 saves)\\nBuffalo Sabres--Fuhr (3-0) (34 shots - 31 saves)\\n\\nATT-16,325\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWashington Capitals                       1   1   1   0   -   3\\nNew York Islanders   (leads series 2-1)   1   0   2   1   -   4\\n\\n1st period: NYI, Thomas 1 - 16:37\\n\\t    WAS, Burridge 1 - (May, Cavallini) 18:58\\n\\n2nd period: WAS, Carpenter 1 - (Ridley, Bondra) 6:18\\n\\n3rd period: WAS, Elynuik 1 - (Carpenter, Ridley) 6:15\\n\\t    NYI, Thomas 2 - (Turgeon, King) 11:11\\n\\t    NYI, Turgeon 3 - (Thomas, Hogue) 19:17\\n\\n1 Overtime: NYI, Ferraro 3 - (Hogue, Flatley) 4:46\\n\\nPowerplay Opportunities-Capitals  0 of 2\\n\\t\\t\\tIslanders 0 of 4\\n\\nShots on Goal-\\tCapitals   10   8   6   1  -  25\\n\\t\\tIslanders  10   6   8   6  -  30\\n\\nWashington Capitals--Tabaracci (1-2) (25 shots - 21 saves)\\nNew York Islanders--Healy (2-1) (30 shots - 27 saves)\\n\\nATT-14,180\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, no.

He\\'ll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec.  IMO I would\\ntake Kariya.  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in\\nthe World Championships.  Daigle didn\\'t show this for his junior team.\\n\\nSan Jose will then get Kariya.\\n\\nTampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov (I think that\\'s it) or a \\n    defenseman Rob Niedemeyer (probably spelt the last name wrong)\\n\\nBecause of expansion I won\\'t go further but I will name other of the\\nblue chip prospects\\n\\n   - Chris Gratton\\n   - Chris Pridham\\n   - a swedish player who I can\\'t remember his name\\n\\nDraft Order\\n-----------\\n1) Ottawa\\n2) San Jose\\n3) Tampa Bay\\n4) South Florida or Anahiem\\n5) South Florida or Anahiem\\n6) Hartford\\n7) Edmonton\\n8) Dallas\\n9) NY Rangers\\n10) Philadelphia\\n\\nthe 8th thru 10th picks could be wrong - I don\\'t have the standings here\\nand am guessing \\n\\n(In my mind there are 8 top notch prospects in the draft, with Kariya \\n leading the way but not going #1)\\nMy votes (FWIW):\\n\\nTeam MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has \\n36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain\\nthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and\\nMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than\\nMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on\\nthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess\\nI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.\\n\\nBiggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season\\nas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+\\npoints. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming\\nfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew\\nCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \\nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\\nright side.\\n\\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \\nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar\\nafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of\\ncompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better\\nhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only\\nseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got\\nto make a number of starts in a row.\\nLet\\'s start over.  I\\'m not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I\\'d\\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\\nare similar.  And with that, I just don\\'t see how you can label Roussel as\\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\\n\\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\\n\\n\\nBut I\\'m not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I\\'ve seen him play\\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It\\'s just\\nmy opinion, but I think he\\'s got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I\\'m\\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\\n\\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\\nsave.  If he didn\\'t, it wouldn\\'t have mattered if the Rangers player didn\\'t\\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that\\'s\\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\\nshooter to beat him.\\n\\n\\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can\\'t tell me that a\\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\\npart of the game.  Or there\\'d never be shutouts.\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\\nI\\'m not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current\\n7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I\\ndon\\'t want to piss you off to the point that you don\\'t sell me any\\ntickets next season:-).[Deletions]\\n\\nGeez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted\\'s drink sometime.  Comparing\\nPrince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well in\\nthe minors and he\\'s now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter\\nin the minors.  (I\\'ll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don\\'t have\\nanother brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville \\nbefore coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up\\nin the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the \\nmajors and didn\\'t hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he \\nbecame Exhibit 312 in Nichols\\' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation \\nas an outstanding defensive catcher.  It\\'s not clear he ever learned to\\nhit.

If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince,\\ngiven that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it\\'s not\\na rosy picture.\\n\\nBTW, I\\'m still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation \\ncoming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was\\na much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter\\nand a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter\\nas an average (or below average) fielding catcher.\\n\\nHarold\\nThis is the price hockey fans have to pay for the mistake of leaving\\nESPN 5 or 6 years ago...it will take time to correct for that mistake.\\n\\nBut returning to ESPN was the correct decision last year...by next\\ntime, we may have the potential for Sportschannel and ESPN to really\\ncompete to offer better coverage and be forced to deliver on it.\\nThere are ALWAYS scalpers with tickets outside the Arena.

And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\\n\\n#10\\tJOHAN GARPENLOV\\t\\tSeason: 3rd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\\n\\t\\tpick in \\'92 entry draft from Vancouver\\nGrade:\\t\\tA/A-\\n\\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\\nhis small size (5\\' 11\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\\n\\n#15\\tDAVID BRUCE\\t\\tSeason: 5th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nAfter a banner \\'91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\\nshort in the Sharks\\' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\\n\\n#18\\tMARK PEDERSON\\t\\tSeason:\\t3rd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B)\\n\\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers\\' decision to unload Pederson,\\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he\\'s not considered a\\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\\n\\n#20\\tJOHN CARTER\\t\\tSeason: 4th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, free agent from Boston\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+/B)\\n\\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\\n\\n#28\\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+/B)\\n\\nI don\\'t understand why the Sharks didn\\'t let Quintin play any more than the\\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\\ncamp before the \\'91-92 season limited Quintin, the team\\'s leading scorer in\\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\\n\\n#41\\tMARK BEAUFAIT\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\\nalthough it\\'s too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\\nKansas City.\\n\\n#42\\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\\n\\n#44\\tMICHEL PICARD\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B-/C+)\\n\\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks\\' bait in the\\nexpansion draft.\\n\\n#45\\tDODY WOOD\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn\\'t give a grade at all)\\n\\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He\\'s not ready, and needs at\\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5\\' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\\nActually, fired-coach George Kingston was a third of the GM\\ntriumvirate.  Now that the trio is now duo (Dean Lombardi and Chuck\\nGrillo), the Sharks are already on their 3rd \"office of the GM\". And a\\n4th is likely to happen before September; they\\'ll either add the new\\ncoach to the OofGM, or name a single GM. So your wager should be\\namended to read that Sharks are likely to have their 5th GM before the\\nPanther\\'s get their 2nd. Can\\'t wait to see how the next season\\'s NHL\\nGuide and Record Book lists the GM history of the Sharks.\\n\\nGiven the depth of next year\\'s draft, the expansion draft rules, and\\nthe reputation of their GMs, Anaheim and Miami look pretty good as the\\nfirst 90s expansion teams to win a Cup.

That seriously\\nunderrepresents the harm he has done in the field.\\n\\nOwen will cleanly play any ball he reaches.  He will have a fine\\nfielding percentage, like always.  The problem is that he doesn\\'t\\nreach anything that isn\\'t hit straight at him!\\n\\nThis wouldn\\'t be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to\\nKelly Gruber or Robin Ventura.  But the third baseman for the Yankees\\nis Wade Boggs (who should have moved across the diamond *last* year)!\\n\\nI\\'ve only seen one game, Abbott\\'s first start, but there were three\\nballs hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality\\ndefensive players.  Instead they were charged as hits against Abbott.\\nOk, but have you seen Tabaracci play yet?  In his two starts and\\nhis relief effort for Beaupre, he has looked mighty sharp - don\\'t\\nforget the shutout.  I think he\\'s let in just four goals over eight\\nperiods of play.  I like Hrivnak, but we might actually have to give\\nsome credit to David Poile for a change after this trade.\\n\\nHopefully if Tabaracci starts against the Isles tonight, I haven\\'t\\njinxed him.\\nRuotsaleinen was a more than competent NHL\\'er...his choice of where\\nto play when did not bear on his hockey playing ability.\\n\\nHe was crucial to the Oilers Stanley Cup victory in 1990, the one\\nwithout Gretzky, because he made an Oiler power play which was\\nlethargic that year until he arrived slide into overdrive.  The\\nOilers missed him more the following year than Kurri, and I think\\nthe Oilers would have make the finals if Ruotsaleinen has stayed\\naround the following season, and would have beaten Pittsburgh\\nwith Ruotsaleinen and a healthy Messier...and delayed Pittsburgh\\'s\\ndynasty by a season.  Does anyone know where Billy Taylor is?  Richmond or Syracuse?  He was taken\\nby the Jays in the Rule V draft, but not kept on the roster.  Baseball Weekly\\nsaid that he was demoted to Syracuse, but a Toronto paper indicated that\\nthe Braves took him back.  Is there an Atlanta fan, or anyone reading this,\\nwho knows?   \\n\\nIt is no matter what you call the teams, Jokerit and TPS, or Helsinki Tornado\\nand Turku Typhoon, the best palyers in Finland would eventually end up in\\nthose teams anyway, if they were in the \"big\" league. \\n\\nPhiladelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday\\n     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four\\ngame series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.\\n\"What could be better,\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs\\nare challenging?\\n     \"It\\'s pitching, it\\'s always been pitching that we\\'ve lacked,\" announced\\nRyne Sandberg.  \"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or\\nBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we\\'ll know we might be able to\\nwin.\\n     \"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\"\\n     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete\\nRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut\\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\\ngap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell\\'s speed allowed him to cut the ball off\\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \\n     \"Teams are starting to realize that you don\\'t have to pitch to Schmidt or\\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\\nRose at first), and it\\'s a credit to the Phillies that they\\'ve been able to\\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas\\' grounder\\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\\n     Sunday\\'s twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\\neighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would\\nconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st\\n     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.\\nThe Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren\\'t among the\\nall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first\\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of\\nfirst in this wacky season.\\n     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2\\nSaturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\\nThe Cards captured Monday\\'s game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\\nRogers 3-2.  \"We\\'re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\\nteam speed,\" remarked Lou Brock.  \"I don\\'t see why we can\\'t win this\\ndivision.\"\\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of\\nthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,\\nnow 2 back - but in 4th!\\n    \"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a\\npitcher\\'s park like this,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith\\nHernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\"  The Pirates have made only\\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend\\nto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.\\n     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone\\nSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When\\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets\\' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \\n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\\npitching that just wouldn\\'t tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves\\' park had been a homer\\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday\\'s\\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the \\'61 Yankees\\' pace.\\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves\\' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff\\'s batting average was even rising.  Of\\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can\\'t afford\\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can\\'t\\nDavis will get decked once.\"\\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\\nthe nastness of the Astros\\' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It\\'s as if some three-year-old threw a\\ntantrum and told his playmates: \\'If I can\\'t hit home runs, nobody will hit\\nhome runs\\',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\\nAstros didn\\'t score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\\n     \"They\\'re going to be beating the ball down, so we\\'ve got to be ready to\\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We\\'ll go with\\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers\\'\\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\\n     \"We\\'re mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he\\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\\nplays can do it now and then.  We\\'re sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\\nguess that\\'s why they\\'re so successful there.\"  Indeed, it seems that\\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The \\'Stros\\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\\n     Standings after these weekend series:\\nA.L.East\\nTeam                     W           L           GB\\nNew York                68        42          --\\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\\nDetroit                 64        46           4\\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\\nWashington              39         73          28\\n\\nA.L.West\\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\\nMinnesota               61         48            1\\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\\nCalifornia              57         56            8\\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\\n\\nN.L.East\\nChicago          57         53                --\\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\\nNew York         48         64               10\\n\\nN.L.West\\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\\nHouston          50          61               17.5\\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5\\n\\n\\nI heard it will be the Minnesota-Detroit game.

Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of \\ndetracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what \\nhappens come September.

Fielding Runs thus gives a first\\nbaseman no credit for putouts or double plays, only for assists and\\nerrors.  \\n\\nIt thus favors first basemen who play deep, reaching a lot of balls but\\nforcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently.

But that\\'s OK, I understand you\\nhave a hockey background. Stats like \"plus/minus\" make RBI look good.\\n\\n\\nOK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here\\'s a very simele question to which\\nI\\'m sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\\nAL only, please.\\n\\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\\nthat a team\\'s win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It\\'s not a definite,\\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\\'t take into account that Viola\\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\\nevaluate Viola\\'s as better than Morris\\' in the sense that \"had Morris\\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\\n\\n\\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\\n\\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.comTuesday\\'s game of Beloved Yakult Swallows\\n\\n(At Jingu, 36,000)\\nHanshin Tigers   001 000 100 |2\\nBeloved Yakult   050 020 00x |7\\n\\nW - Ito (1-0).

I agree that you and I could probably argue\\nback and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey-\\nthat is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better \\nthan yours or yours than mine?

Which leads to below:\\n\\n\\nI think at this point there\\'s a personal, emotional element involved here\\nwhich transcends Murray\\'s logical thought.  As outsiders, it\\'s fine for \\nus to say, \"He should hire a different coach.\"  In fact, he has talked about\\ndoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so\\nbuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of\\nthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to \\nprove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second\\nround.  He needs to, as the papers say, \"get that monkey off his back.\"\\nSo it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish\\nto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we\\'re all\\na little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he\\'ll step down\\nfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will\\nimprove as a result.\\n\\nI think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent\\non GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we\\'ll see how\\ngood of a GM he really is.\\n\\n\\nI may not agree with everything you\\'ve said, but it\\'s been fun discussing\\nit with you.\\nBobby Bonilla supposedly use the word \\'faggot\\' when he got mad at that author\\nin the clubhouse.

This was one of his main problems when\\nplaying for Buffalo.\\n\\n: GO LEAFS !!!\\nGO SABRES !!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe other Jewish HOF\\'er is Rod Carew (who converted).  \\n\\nLowenstein is Jewish, as well as Montana\\'s only representative to the\\nmajor leagues.\\n\\nUndeserving Cy Young award winner Steve Stone is Jewish.  Between Stone,\\nKoufax, Ken Holtzman (? might have the wrong pitcher, I\\'m thinking of the\\none who threw a no-hitter in both the AL and NL), and Big Ed Reulbach,\\nthat\\'s quite a starting rotation.  Moe Berg can catch.  Harry Steinfeldt,\\nthe 3b in the Tinkers-Evers-Chance infield.\\n\\nIs Stanky Jewish?  Or is that just a \"Dave Cohen\" kinda misinterpretation?\\nWhatever, doesn\\'t look like he stuck around the majors too long.\\nRegardless, they\\'d have to sparkle from the pressbox.  Errey\\'s been\\nout a couple games with a hip injury.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat was Clint Malarchuk.  That was a very dangerous accident.  He could he\\ndied right there on the ice.  However, he has played since  \\nbut I don\\'t know where he is now.  I think he is still playing but I\\'m\\nnot positive.  He was a Sabre at the time.\\nI don\\'t know who skated into him though.\\n\\n\\nI remember a couple of seasons before the Malarchuk incident Borje\\nSalming of Toronto fell down in the crease and someone skated into\\nhis face.  That took a lot of stiches to fix.\\n\\nYou can\\'t be serious!  I and many of my colleagues have not received any\\nbad e-mails from Roger, in fact, Roger happens to have answered most if not\\nall of my hockey questions and curiosities, so before you start flaming\\nat me or Roger, better re-consider your nasty attitude towards Roger and the\\nlike!\\n\\n\\nUntil six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL football.\\nLast year I hardly watched a game.  What turned me off were the\\nincessant interruptions to the continuity of the game.  A team scores.\\n2.5 minutes of commercials.  Kickoff.  1.5 minutes of commercials.\\nThree downs and a punt.  2 minutes of commercials.  AAAAARRRRGH!\\n\\nEarlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A\\'s, whom I\\nbelieve institutionalize slow play.  I don\\'t mind the cat-and-mouse\\ngame with Rickey on first;  in fact, I rather enjoy it.  Similarly\\nI would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first.  What\\nI object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first,\\nor when the game is a blowout.  I don\\'t mind when the pitcher steps off \\nthe mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation, or when a hitter\\nsteps out of the box to regain his concentration.  What I object to\\nis when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity.\\nWhen a game is exciting, these little delays serve as tension builders\\nand for me enhance the value of the experience of the game.  When the\\ndelays happen with regularity, they become nuisances, just like the\\ncommercial breaks in football.  \\n\\nI understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to \"speed up\"\\nthe games, basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move\\nthe markers and the ball to the spots faster.  That did not address\\nthe problem of the continuity of the game.  It may have appeased the\\nsponsors and the networks, but I would be amazed if it did anything\\nto enhance the experience of the fans.\\n\\nSimilary, while some 3-hour baseball games bore me to tears, those are the\\nones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly\\nlong periods to get ready for each pitch.  I doubt if anyone watching\\nthe Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out.  I doubt if anyone\\nwatching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an\\nopportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that\\nwas present.  I would be totally opposed to any effort that would\\neliminate that aspect of baseball.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful\\nenough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that they\\nare actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games \\nout the way that they do.  I sure wouldn\\'t mind a little arm-twisting\\nthere.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll have to disagree with you on this one. I think Vancouver will go as\\nBure goes, and if he continues on his goal scoring slump, then they\\nwon\\'t even make it out of the first round. I think the Kings will make\\nit out of the first round, regardless of who they play. They seem to be\\ndoing pretty well, even with that bad game against Minnesota on\\nSaturday. I think it\\'ll be either Calgary or Los Angeles to win the\\nSmythe (i.e. go on to the conference finals). \\n\\n\\nI heard yesterday that Pocklington was talking with folks at Copps\\nthat afternoon (yesterday).  \\n\\nIn <1993Apr16.140953.5025@vax.cns..edu>, jbrown@vax.cns.muskingum.edu writes...\\n\\nI would appreciate it if you would not refer to Mr. Maynard by his\\ninitials.

He hit .354/.439/.517 with runners in scoring position!\\n\\nThe difference?  Alomar had 68 RBIs in 147 such AB.  Baerga had 81\\nRBIs in 182 such AB.

But if I did, my vote would\\ngo to Alomar for MVP (let alone \"best 2B in the AL\").\\nThere are very few disciplines where 100% certainty is necessary to\\nstate something as fact.

I have NEVER seen a player, and that\\nincludes Russell Courtnall and Davie Keon, screw up as many breakaways as\\nBob Gainey.  And I will never forget the time Denis Potvin caught Gainey\\nwith his head down.  You have been sold a bill of goods on Bob Gainey.\\n\\nGainey was a plugger.  And when the press runs out of things to say about \\nthe stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers.  Grant Fuhr, Essa\\nTikkannen, Butch Goring, Bob Nystrom, Bob Gainey, Doug Jarvis, Derek\\nSanderson, Wayne Cashman, Bob Baun, Bob Pulford, Ralph Backstrom, Henri\\nRichard, Dick Duff...and so on...\\n\\ncordially, as always,\\n\\nrm\\n\\n \\n\\nPerhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that YOU have seen.  For\\nmost of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity, \\nit was *nowhere* *near* the most exciting game...\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, the instant replay is not used on hits.  At first, I\\nimmediately thought \"5 and a game\" because the hit _looked_ much more severe\\nfrom an intent-to-injure perspective than it was.  After seeing the replay,\\nI\\'d say it deserved 2-4 minutes for boarding (it was careless any way you \\nslice it).  If Stewart had replay, I do not think Chaisson would have gotten\\n5 and the game.\\n\\n\\nThis no-call was bullshit, I agree. I admire Stewart for letting them go, but\\nProbert *looked* *up* saying where the hell is the penalty?  I\\'ve never\\nseen Probert whine either (he doesn\\'t need to).  Now, if Probie\\ndecides to put Wendel through the boards, he\\'s probably gone, right?\\n\\n\\nThis was also bullshit.  But once again, no replay.  It was Rouse, btw. I\\'m\\nreally pissed that the linesmen didn\\'t correct the call either....it\\'s b.s.\\nwhen the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake.  \\n\\n\\nYes.  The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit\\nloss.  I picked the Leafs to win Game 3 on emotion and adrenalin, but the\\nWings have no excuses for Game 4.  They should be the superior team.\\n\\nThe call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his\\nstick in somebody\\'s eye.  That was _the_ most dangerous stick infraction I\\nhave seen in a long time, and everybody in the damn league _knows_ he\\'s an\\nasshole when it comes to stickwork.  Four lousy minutes.  Bullshit call. \\nMurray should send the tape in.  Or a Wing should hammer the living shit out\\nof him.\\n\\n\\nAnd it is a damn good thing that she did post it since she claims to represent\\npeople in rec.sport.hockey.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer sole purpose in mentioning the net, as Steve Gallichio has already \\npointed out, is to lend weight to her points through association with the\\ninternet.  There is no other reason to mention the internet.  This is \\nmisrepresentation and if the internet was a private corporation Alison\\nwould be leaving herself wide open to all kinds of civil suits.\\n\\n\\nThis is not a letter.  It is a petition claiming to represent a large\\nproportion of rec.sport.hockey users, and by implication, a significant\\nnumber of internet users.  65 names can in no way be considered a \\n\"large\" proportion of rec.sport.hockey which, while we have no way of\\ncounting actual readership, is accessible to hundreds of thousands of\\npeople.  65 persons is no more than a fly\\'s fart in a windstorm.\\n \\n\\n\\nGee.

I\\'d have another question:  who would \\noperate the pitch clock?  One of the umpires?  Add another one to the crew?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not sure I like this idea.  I think it would severely diminish the \\nnumber of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic\\nploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play (one of my personal favorites).\\n\\n\\nAhhh!  I suppose I should read the whole article before I hit the \\'f\\' key,\\neh?  Obviously, from what I wrote above, I like this idea.\\n\\n\\nIt may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag, since the \\npitcher knows he doesn\\'t have very many chances to pick off the runner,\\nso he may hurry too much.  I\\'d rather see runs scored as the result of \\nsound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness\\nthat could result from this kind of rule.  So, I suppose there are some\\ndisadvantages to that idea too.\\n\\n\\n\\nI remember in little league, if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter\\'s\\nbox, even for a moment, we were automatically out.  That may be a little \\nharsh for the majors, but seriously, how about putting a limit on the \\nbatters being able to step out, take several dozen practice swings, pound\\ntheir shoes, scratch their balls, etc.?  Maybe forcing them to stay in the\\nbatter\\'s box wouldn\\'t be such a bad idea.  That could save a few minutes.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nThe events I saw were:\\n1)  Called strike by Hirschbeck\\n2)  Shocked-looking Gant asks for appeal to first\\n3)  No appeal to first\\n4)  Gant steps out of batters box.\\n5)  Hirschbeck *immediately* orders Gant back in.  [bad move]\\n6)  Gant ignores Hirschbeck and walks off. [bad move]\\n7)  Hirschbeck yells at Gant.  Gant is silent.\\n8)  Hirschbeck calls for the pitch.\\n9)  Pitch is called a strike.\\n10)  Cox argues (couldn\\'t see when he came on the field)\\n11)  Cox is ejected, players everywhere\\n12)  Play finally resumes.\\n\\nGant shouldn\\'t have ignored Hirschbeck.  Not returning made the strike\\ncall fairly likely.  Although I suspect an argument might have gotten\\nGant tossed altogether.  But if Hirschbeck had let Gant step out, the\\nwhole incident probably would have been avoided.\\n-- \\nDale J.

Le Magnifique!  Soixante Six!  Claude...NON!\"The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to\\ndeath, but I haven\\'t seen anything in rsb yet.\\n\\nGerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two\\non and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the\\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\\n\\nNow I\\'ve seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan\\'s glove was essentially\\nbehind Darryl\\'s.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\\n\\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don\\'t care about \\nwinning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made\\nthe catch.\\n\\nBefore each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech\\nwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that\\nare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any \\nthat are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\\nimpossible.\\n\\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\\nnine games.\\n\\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\\nhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,\\nhe certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.\\n\\nBut I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities\\nof the fan.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\nNo no no!!!  It\\'s a squid!  Keep the tradition alive!  (Kinda like the\\nfish at UNH games....)Is there any doubt that this is true?  After a few down years, the A.L. East\\nis back to where it was in the early eighties.  With the emergence of the O\\'s\\nand the Yanks, it is far and away the best.  While the N.L. West has the best\\nteam in baseball, and the Reds aren\\'t bad either, they have nothing else.  The\\nGiants, Astros, and Padres all have talent, they do not have the all arounf\\nteams that are found in the A.L. East.  And the Dodgers just plain suck.  As\\nfor the Rockies, who knows?\\n   The A.L. East has the defending champs, and although they lost a lot to\\nfree agency, Toronto is still one of the best in baseball.  The Orioles have\\nthe preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina, and you can never\\nforget about Ripken.  The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don\\'t\\nhurt to much either, although I always liked Bill Ripken.  While they let a\\nlot go this summer (Randy Milligan, Joe Orsulak, Bill Ripken, Bob Milacki, Sam\\nHorn, Storm Davis, and Craig Lefferts), they kept the heart of their team\\nintact.\\n\\nMy predicted finish:\\n1. Baltimore (Could be a biased opinion)\\n2. NY Yankees\\n3. Toronto\\n4. Milwaukee\\n5. Detroit\\n6. Boston\\n7. Cleveland (Would have been higher if not for the accident)\\n\\nGo O\\'s!!!!!!!!\\n\\nThere are several reasons for this difference.  The main reason is that\\ngood hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull)\\nare rarely regular DH\\'s, even if they can\\'t field; it\\'s more commonly a\\nplace to put aging veterans.\\n\\nAnother use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury\\nslowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the\\nfield.  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH\\'s than they did\\nduring the rest of the season.\\n\\nA third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first\\nor the outfield don\\'t hit as well as DH\\'s for some reason.  Reggie\\nJackson was a good example; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, he\\nhit like the old Reggie when he was in right.\\n\\nThe second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by\\ntheir primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60\\nat DH will count only in the right fielders\\' averages.\\n\\n\\nThis makes sense; you might also look at it another way.  Although the\\n*average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left\\nfielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly\\nlower; if you are a left fielder but can\\'t hit well enough to keep a job\\nanywhere, then you certainly can\\'t hit well enough to keep a job at DH.\\n\\n\\nI had heard(perhaps incorrectly) that while Lemieux was out, noone wore a\\nC on their jersey.  The As took turns doing captain duties(whatever they\\nare).\\n\\nScott...\\nscott.marks@launchpad.unc.edu\\nscott.marks@launchpad.unc.edu\\nYes, he does.  BUT, the goalie sure as hell doesn\\'t want him there!  When\\nI played roller hockey (boy do I miss those days) as a goalie, I would\\nscream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot.  I don\\'t care if he\\'s\\nin the crease or not, get him the hell away from me so I can see the ball!\\n(Yes, roller hockey, remember)  And if there was nobody around to clear\\nthe slot, then I\\'d do it myself by pushing the offending player--*hard*. \\nI *hate* people in my way when I\\'m the goalie, and I am sure Felix does\\ntoo.  I should say that I didn\\'t see the incident, so if Potvin really\\nswung the stick big time, then that\\'s not right, but he can move people\\nout of the way.  He\\'s a player on the ice too, you know.  :-)\\n\\nThey _finally_ started going to the net!  See what happens when you \\ncreate some traffic?  Muller deserves full marks (what a player!),\\nand Damphousse finally started skating.  Roy (thankyouthankyouthankyou)\\nwas excellent.  Did you see that third period save on Young?  And the \\ndefense was taking out Quebec players in the zone.\\n\\nAnybody else wonder if Hextall will feel like a dweeb when he finds \\nout that the winning goal went in off his own D-man\\'s skate?  Whatta\\nsuck.  Although he _is_ playing really well.\\n\\n\\nSure it does.  On Sunday when the B\\'s are golfing and the Habs are tied\\n2-2 you\\'ll see what I mean! :-) :-)\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s rich... Ozzie Smith a defensive liability...\\tThe Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost\\nidentical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as\\nVancouver outscored Winnipeg 3-2.\\n\\tThe pattern of the first game was repeated tonight, with the Canucks\\nscoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period, only to stave\\noff a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. The Jets\\nlooked more dangerous in this one but it didn\\'t make a difference in the \\nnumbers that counted: goals.\\n\\tVancouver\\'s big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and\\nleft winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to \\nboost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of\\nBautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent\\nin opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.\\n\\tHowever, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the\\ngame to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,\\nchecking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged\\nby a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. \\n\\tThe hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught\\nVancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make\\nthe score 2-1. \\n\\tDomi\\'s goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush\\nto the Canuck\\'s collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do \\nanything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were\\nallowed to set up and make plays.\\n\\tBoth goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.\\nMcLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne\\nwhile Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous\\non the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck\\nzone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four\\nchecking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.\\n\\tA series of minor penalties at the end of the second period\\nresulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The\\nJet\\'s Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean\\'s\\nlegs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.\\n\\tThe Canuck\\'s discordant play picked up where it left off.\\nThis was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected\\nor were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight\\nWinnipeg defence that were never supported.\\n\\tHowever, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive\\nlapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff\\nin the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with\\nno Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the\\ngame up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a \\nbackhand even though he was off balance. \\n\\tBy then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it\\nto the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing\\nfor their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2.\\n\\tNext game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games.\\n- 30 -\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI suspect that splits such as these are the result of positioning.  An\\noutfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a\\nlot of balls, preventing both singles and doubles, and also cut off more\\nuncatchable balls, turinging doubles into singles.  However, a fielder\\nwho plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies; this\\nmeans that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles.\\n\\nHas anyone seen these players\\' positioning?  Do Butler and Felix play\\ndeep, and Lankford, Martinez, and Wilson shallow, or is this a park\\neffect?  I thought Butler liked to play shallow.\\nboxscores.\\n\\nBeware.

The Mariners\\nhad the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which the\\nfielder catches.  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw.  \\n\\nNow, without a judgement call (and I don\\'t think there is one), this is an RBI\\nfor the batter.  It seems to me that a better name for this would be \"defensive\\nindifference\", since it doesn\\'t really matter whether the guy at third scores\\nat that point.  (I know, I can think of several \"If the Mariners stole third\\nand second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a\\ngrounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and\\nthird, he wouldn\\'t have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and\\nmaybe he therefore can\\'t make the throw to first to get the last out, etc...\\nscenarios, too.  But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when\\nyou\\'re down by 4?  If the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.)\\n\\nThe point is that the batter (IMO) shouldn\\'t get \"credit\" (an RBI) for utterly\\nfailing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, not\\ntrade an out for one run.  What do you guys think?\\nHis performance at the plate may well be from the shoulder injury\\nreceived when he ran into the wall making a catch in the Cincy series.\\nIt may also be him pressing a little.\\n\\nAs for the baserunning, it does not appear to be just Lankford.\\nDent made the bad call sending Lankford in the Sunday night game\\nagainst Cincy - but everyone had a bad time against the Dodger\\'s catcher.\\n\\n\\nGood question.

Don was holding a hot dog that\\nhe bought from the concession stand.\\n\\nRon Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the\\nToronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow\\nand proclaimed \"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks\\nof me. Beauty.\"\\n\\nNext, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to\\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\\nthe arenas in the NHL.\\n\\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game\\nhad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game\\nin the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All\\nstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary\\nby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most\\npenalties gets to ref in the finals.\\n\\nNext, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for\\nthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the\\nwins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup\\nand the AHL championships.\\n\\nFinally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the\\nRangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.\\nDon feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had\\nseveral key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who\\nwent cold.\\n\\nDon had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party\\'s over,\\nAdolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer\\nbe a \\'country club\\'.... \"NY should be achamed of themselves... If\\nthey go in the tank with Adolf there, they\\'ll be hanging from the\\nyardarm by their thumbs.\"\\n\\n\\nRating\\n------\\nNothing too special in this episode.\\n\\nI\\'ll give it a 5.5 out of 10.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   \\\\  \\\\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\\n    \\\\  \\\\                  |Department of Computing Science,\\n     \\\\  \\\\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\\n      \\\\    ###  \\\\     _   |---------------------------------------------------\\n       \\\\___###___\\\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\\n credit...\"          - U. of A.

Also, it\\'s not the volume of trades that will \\nnecessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates\\nfor Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a \\ngreat player at one time.  Most of Murray\\'s trades have worked significantly\\nto the Wings\\' advantage, with those that didn\\'t being soured mainly by \\ninjury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back\\nproblems from which he never really recovered).\\n\\nPut Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the \\nleague behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.Subject line says it all.

Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie.\\nThe third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scored\\nthree unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark.\\nThey were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted by\\nPaul Kariya.\\n\\nThe last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow also\\nproved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU\\ngoalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by\\nboth.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game.\\n\\nThis year\\'s three championships games were sold out last year in about one\\nmonth.

There\\'s no sense in expanding if it only means\\nmore failing franchises are in the mold.\\n\\nDon\\'t let this confuse anybody.

Perhaps if\\na man is mentally \"strained\", then sitting him down might help to the\\nextent that that helps him relax.

fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\\nStillwell would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kurt\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt\\'s 57.6% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Double\\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.

These ratings, of course,\\nare subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as\\npossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks\\nand/or did not play for another NHL team this season.\\n\\nThus, then, let\\'s go to the goaltenders...\\n\\n#1\\tBRIAN HAYWARD\\t\\tSeason:\\t11th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tP (D)\\n\\nIt is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that\\nfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in \\'87, \\'88, and\\n\\'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\\n\\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks\\' first\\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\\n\\n#30\\tJEFF HACKETT\\t\\tSeason: 3rd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tC\\n\\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team\\'s #1 goalie to\\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\\nbut upon return, he simply wasn\\'t up to the task.  He may not return next\\nyear.\\n\\n#31\\tWADE FLAHERTY\\t\\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A-)\\n\\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades\\'\\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it\\'s time for him to show that he can\\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn\\'t make it next year, he\\nmay not ever.\\n\\n#32\\tARTURS IRBE\\t\\tSeason:\\t1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB+\\n\\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\\nhe\\'s a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\\nthe team\\'s first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\\na playoff spot next season, Irbe\\'s the key, as he demonstrated in being named\\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\\nNESN owns the rights to Bruin telecasts.  I suspect that NESN was only\\ngoing to sell one telecast to ESPN (remember, ESPN only owns exclusive\\nrights to the FINALS, not the entire playoffs).  Since ESPN bought the\\nSCA contract, there are less wrangles to untie with showing the Devils\\nand Penguins.\\n\\n\\nI think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it.  Plus they\\nhave no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule\\nunless the NHL was willing to make a western club move up their game.\\nI think the NHL got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for ABC.\\n\\n\\nSame exact coverage as last week:  Pit-NJ game 4 in the east, Chi-StL\\nin the central, LA-Cgy in the mountains and west.\\n\\n\\nMatt\\'s problem is really more ability than attitude.  It isn\\'t that he\\'s\\ngot it in his mind that he wants to swing away, but rather that he\\'s\\n(still) a total sucker for the curve ball.  It looked for a while in\\n1990 that he was getting better but it\\'s still his weak point.\\n\\nAs to whether it does him any good to have Bonds behind him, the \\nnet.stat.mavens will probably tell you there\\'s no reason that it\\nshould, but if he thinks it will, it might be a self-fulfilling\\nprophecy.\\n\\nAs to whether the Giants\\' lineup is optimal:  who knows?  Batting Bonds,\\nthe team\\'s best hitter, fifth does seem to be odd, but the #1 and #2\\nhitters aren\\'t exactly Messrs. OBA, so they aren\\'t giving much up\\nthere.  And although Clark isn\\'t the overall offensive force that Bonds\\nis, he seems better suited to the #3 spot.  Assuming, of course, that\\nhe starts hitting one of these days...\\nJason Lee asks:\\n\\nYou must have heard wrong.  His arm is still sore.  He hasn\\'t gone on the DL,\\nbut he may.  Managmenet is treating him as a day-to-day situation.  \\n\\nHis doctors thought that he was ready, and they had him throw in\\nColorado, but his arm wasn\\'t up to the strain.  He is throwing every day,\\nbut he\\'s just not quite ready to pitch full strength yet.\\n\\n(This is based on an interview that he gave on WFAN NY radio on Thursday,\\n4/23)\\nThe Phillies finished third 2 years ago.\\n\\n\\nThe Phillies\\' opponents haven\\'t hit much better\\nMLB is perfectly willing to take players from Cuba.

I laugh at you now, and I will laugh at you again, equally publicly,\\nwhen the Jays finish third due to the severe depletion of their talent.\\nI think Bill James put it best (about Sparky Anderson, _Abstract_ 1983):\\n\\n\"There are a million guys in this country with great attitudes, but there\\nare only about five hundred who can play a major league brand of baseball;\\nwhich are you going to take?\"\\nWell, maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who \"hasn\\'t \\nmatured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old \\nwho is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and \\nhave looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim \\nDeshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies \\nhasn\\'t looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has \\ngone to Trombley, although they hadn\\'t wanted 3 starters this unproven. \\nI personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.\\n\\n\\nWell, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but \\nwas a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is \\nsplit (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry \\nJorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 \\nyears.  I\\'m not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be \\nhappy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson, but I fear they \\nmight give too much time to Pags.\\n \\n\\nSorry, can\\'t help you here.If there is a \"USA Today ftp site\" could someone please post it to the \\n   newsgroup so everyone will stop posting the \"send it to me too\" articles.\\n   I\\'m sure many people woulds like to know so why not just post it to the net\\n   rather than mailing hundreds of people. \\n\\n   Just a thought. \\n\\n\\n    Thanks,    Ryan Robin.HELP!

Thanks in advance.\\nThis comes up periodically, and I just don\\'t get it. Take, for example, Mark\\nMcGwire. He walked 90 times in 1993. If that\\'s not a potential great example\\nof what you\\'re talking about then I don\\'t know what is. Now let\\'s look at\\nwhat happens when McGwire doesn\\'t walk:\\n  75% of the time he made an out.\\n  10% of the time he hit a single.\\n  5% of the time he hit a double.\\n  10% of the time he hit a homer.\\nNow, you\\'re pitching against McGwire. Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers,\\n1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? I would. Why give him the base when you\\ncan get him out 3 times out of 4?\\nThen there are guys like Alex Cole, who has a career .363 OBP even\\nthough he\\'s never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in\\n227 AB in 1990) or hit a single home run. Yep, that\\'s right, he\\'s\\n*never* hit a homer in 916 AB\\'s through the end of 1992.

Kings\\n   I suppose a foul ball machine (like Brett Butler) is pretty valuable,\\n   but I\\'d rather watch (and root for) the lower OBP guys who can\\n   actually hit the ball.\\n\\nAnd I\\'d rather watch (and root for) a team that scores lots of runs\\nand wins games.\\n\\nOf course, I\\'m rooting for the Rockies and Andres anyway.  But that\\'s\\nfor irrational hometown reaons.  I also root for Frank Thomas. :)\\nNo.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the\\nreason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that\\ngoaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn\\'t quite fit if you\\'re\\nMontreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let\\'s face it;\\nhe literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an\\nexcuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst\\ngoals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,\\nStewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.\\n\\nMontreal played a solid game (although they still don\\'t know how to clear\\ntraffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). \\nNormally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than \\nfive, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME \\nESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don\\'t\\nthink this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear \\nthe zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to \\nplay.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic\\'s shot.\\n\\nDemers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let\\nthe damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this\\narticle, if possible.\\n\\n\\nI didn\\'t think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn\\'t\\nthink Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can\\'t remember who)\\nin the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn\\'t have gone in\\nregardless.\\n\\n\\nYep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny\\'s goal with five seconds left in the second,\\nIMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.\\n\\nSpeaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven\\'t seen a\\nteam so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their\\nzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red \\nArmy.  \\n\\nBut I still hate the team.\\n\\nOn the rest of the games:  Didn\\'t St. Louis\\' winning goal come on a\\npowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. \\nSame goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is\\nwaving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something\\'s up.  New\\nJersey was overmatched, Terreri\\'s heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is\\nunbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I \\nhate that team anyway.\\n\\nI heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton.\\nOiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference\\nnext week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed\\nto concern the Oiler\\'s future.\\n\\nRumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement\\nwith Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,\\nPocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that\\nthe deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to\\nrenegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.\\n\\nNorthlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,\\nbut the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.So if Potvin can pound on Dino, what happens when Dino pounds \\non him?  If Dino gets his legs slashed, can he slash Potvin\\nin return?  This year at a UM-LSSU hockey game, a UM player\\nwas called for a slash when he hit the goalie\\'s glove with\\nhis stick.  Is that slashing, while hitting someone\\'s ankles\\nisn\\'t?  How do the refs know what to call?  Do the goalies\\nget more liberties than other players?\\nTeemu Selanne had 3 goals, Keith Tkachuk had one, and Luciano Borsato\\nscored a rare Jets shorthanded goal as the Jets held on to beat the\\nCanucks 5-4, and close the series to 2-1.  Trevor Linden and Pavel\\nBure had two goals each for the Canucks in a losing cause.\\n\\nSelanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump, scoring two powerplay\\ngoals, and one on a nice breakaway pass from Darrin Shannon.\\n\\nHard work paid off tonight for the Jets, and if the Jets continue to\\nexhibit this strong work effort, they can make a series of it. (I woofed\\nlast year when we were up 3-1...I ain\\'t going to do THAT again.  I\\'ll\\nhave to be quietly happy with a solid performance.  ;)Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are \\nfinally moving in the right direction.  They should finish\\nover .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race \\nin August.  However, I would take back a few moves:\\n\\n1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.\\n    I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a\\n    great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year, \\n    but he won\\'t because the right side of the Yanks infield\\n    isn\\'t good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?  \\n    JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and\\n    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on \\n    the Angels?  I know it\\'s early, but if you\\'ve seen this kid\\n    hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be \\n    a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What\\n    about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it\\'s great that the Yanks\\n    have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he\\'s 10 years\\n    older than Snow and just doesn\\'t have the same bat speed as\\n    before his back injury.  It\\'s a shame, but as a Yankee fan \\n    who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I\\'d take \\n    Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two\\n    promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with\\n    Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling\\n    Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts\\n    only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George\\n    forced this trade because he believes (and he\\'s right) that\\n    Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I\\'d like to see the\\n    Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.\\n\\n2.  Wade Boggs.\\n    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is \\n    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop\\n    a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).\\n    Besides, Wade just doesn\\'t have any range.  What a shame about\\n    Charlie Hayes, huh?\\n\\n3.  Spike Owen.\\n    See Wade Boggs.  I\\'d much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri\\n    or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is\\n    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys\\n    are on the down sides of their careers.\\n\\n4.  Danny Tartabull.\\n    Yes - he\\'s put up some tremendous numbers and it\\'s nice to think\\n    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he\\n    never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,\\n    Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O\\'Neil is playing\\n    left field!  I believe O\\'Neil led NL outfielders in assists\\n    last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.\\n\\nWhat I\\'m basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right\\ndirection but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should\\n(at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  This\\nmeans getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they \\nwill be ready in a year or two.  \\n\\nI\\'m afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner.\\nCertainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George is\\nplanning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world\\nseries now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at any\\ntime (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first,\\nthen add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep\\nthem).  Let\\'s all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn\\'t dismantle\\nthe terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee\\norganization back into one of respect.  I\\'m really afraid that he will\\ntrade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for\\nexample).  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is\\nstill one or two years away.  Have patience George and we will all\\nenjoy the future.  Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it\\'s baseball\\nhell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time!Oops!  I came across this file from last year.  Thought you might\\nenjoy some of these thoughts.  The predictions were made on the\\ndate indicated.  They are largely out of order.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nJune 11, 1992\\ntedward@cs.cornell.edu (ME!)\\n\\n\\nYou all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees\\nall disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the\\nexpected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.\\n\\nThe Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn\\'t have surprised\\nanybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the\\nAngels and Royals.  They clearly didn\\'t deserve the 22-33 record in\\nJune.  The White Sox and A\\'s upped their game a bit, while the Twins\\ndropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.\\n\\nOkay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive\\ncalculation, I thought this did pretty well.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFrom CAVGEOE@YaleVM.YCC.Yale.Edu Tue Mar 31 16:36:34 1992\\n\\nHm.  Pete Smith made the rotation instead of Mercker.  And Bielecki\\nwasn\\'t released until the end of the year.  I won\\'t comment on the\\nbullpen.  (Jeff Reardon???  :-)\\n\\n\\nRight on Blauser.  Wrong on Bream and Mitchell.  A bit early on\\nLonnie, as with Bielecki.  Didn\\'t pick Sanders.  (Did anybody? :-)\\n\\n\\nThree of them went, right?  Showalter is still around (and likely to\\nstick, it seems).\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nFrom mattel.Auto-trol.COM!mattel@auto-trol.com Tue Mar 31 17:04:22 1992\\n\\nNope!  They won the division, and so kept him for a shot at the\\nplayoffs.\\n\\n\\n:-)  Well, they didn\\'t finish last.\\n\\n\\nGot that one right.\\n\\n\\nNope.\\n\\n\\nI guess this is why you picked the Mets to win, huh?\\n\\n\\nTsk Tsk.  Not nice to predict something like this.\\n\\n\\nYou got that right!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnd my response...\\n\\n\\nOkay, so the Mets finished fifth.  But I got the Pirates and Expos\\nright!\\n\\n\\nFirst half?  Dead on!  Second half?  Ummm....  I\\'m a Sox fan, go easy\\non me!\\n\\n\\nSo I got my predictions for Gooden and Saberhagen reversed.  :-)  I\\nwas at least *close*, and was right about Jefferies.  (Though I don\\'t\\nknow.  HAS WFAN criticized the Jefferies trade?)\\n\\n\\nClose.  No cigar.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nSome predictions need no introduction!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nSometimes us statheads get lucky.  Grace *didn\\'t* hit behind Dawson\\nthe entire season, but he also finished with only 79 RBIs.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nNope.  He slowed down, and the injury finished him off.  Didn\\'t\\neven reach 50.  But a ballsy prediction, nonetheless.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFrom ECAXRON@MARS.LERC.NASA.GOV Thu May 21 16:42:21 1992\\n\\nThe Orioles finished seven games out.  None of them won 20 (though\\nMussina might have had a chance, with better relief and more starts).\\n\\n\\nExcept for the Brewers (who you probably forgot), you were right!  The\\nrest of the division was thoroughly mediocre.  The Yankees and Indians\\n\"led\" with 76 wins, the Red Sox \"trailed\" with 73 wins.  None were\\nhorrible, but four were five or more games below .500.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFrom: djohnson@cayley.uwaterloo.ca (David Johnson)\\nDate: Thu, 6 Aug 1992 15:47:30 GMT\\n\\n\\nYou win!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFrom king@cogsci.UCSD.EDU Thu Nov 14 14:33:45 1991\\n\\nYou were right!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFrom stvjas@meteor.wisc.edu Fri Sep 13 01:15:52 1991\\n\\nHe had 211 IP, but didn\\'t win the Cy Young.  Maddux surprised all.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t think I want to wait that long.  But they won 89 games last\\nyear, and they were fifth in the league in ERA.  Not a bad start.\\n\\n\\nLooks like it.  He wasn\\'t bad last year, just too consistent to be an\\nace.  So far this year looks like more of the same.\\n\\n\\nI honestly can\\'t say.  Did they get rid of him?  Their BB totals were\\ndown last year.\\n\\n\\nI just don\\'t think he\\'s that good....\\n\\n\\n:-)  So far, so good.  I\\'m *definitely* not waiting to check this one.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFrom panix!spira@cmcl2.NYU.EDU Fri Sep 13 12:38:08 1991\\n\\nCurrent plans seem to be to use Quantrill in long relief.

I know now only\\nof one, Ray Borque for the Bruins.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\nThanx.\\n\\n\\n   Nice post Chuck, but you made just one mistake. Bones is a right-handed\\n   pitcher. However, Hrbek\\'s grand slam came off Graehme Lloyd, a lefty. \\n \\n      And Dino Ciccarelli and Ray Sheppard and so on and so on.....\\n \\n    : )NPR this morning had an interview with Linda McCarthy (name possibly\\ngarbled by me), an official historian for the CIA.  She has won an Emmy\\nfor research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary (which I know from nothing\\nbut which sounds good).  She said that among other things, Berg was the \\nprincipal spy for the OSS (CIA\\'s WWII precursor) spying on Axis atomic\\nprograms, because of his physics background and language skills.  She said\\nthat during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland, and had \\ninstructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb\\nresearch (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn\\'t shoot him).\\n(I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb\\nprogram, but I don\\'t know how reliable this is.)  Unfortunately, NPR didn\\'t\\nmention any kind of a book she\\'s writing -- I\\'d certainly buy it.\\n\\n(In case you\\'re wondering about baseball relevance, Berg was a longtime\\nMLB backup catcher.  He was a member of an MLB All-Star team that toured\\nJapan in 1934, presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because\\nhe was one of the few Americans, much less MLB players, who spoke Japanese.\\nPhotos he took of Tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids,\\naccording to McCarthy.)\\n\\nAs far as I know, Toronto, Pittsburgh, and New York (NL) change their\\nuniforms every year.  Every other year (e.g., New York), it will say Mets\\nin cursive, New York in cursive, or New York in all caps.  Minor changes,\\nbut they do change them often.  Last year, I think they had New York in all\\ncaps.  Did Toronto have Blue Jays or Toronto last year?  What about\\nPittsburgh?\\n\\n\\nI hate the gray.  They should opt for more color (like the White Sox).\\nI hate white team versus gray team.  Spring training uniforms look much\\nbetter.The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but\\nKevin Dineen\\'s 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win,\\n7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the\\ncomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at\\n3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots\\non goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and\\nLaFontaine all night.\\n\\nRoster move:\\n\\nAndre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy\\nscratch.\\n\\nLines:\\n\\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\\nBeranek-Brind\\'Amour-Dineen\\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\\nFaust-Acton-Brown\\n\\nGalley-Bowen\\nYushkevich-Hawgood\\nCarkner-McGill\\n\\nTommy Soderstrom\\n\\nGame Summary:\\n\\nSay, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that\\nwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!\\n\\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\\nhe was getting bored back there...\\n\\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\\nto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\\n\\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\\n\\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\\ndidn\\'t allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn\\'t get anything going and the\\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\\n\\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\\nRuss Farwell\\'s trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they\\'d do\\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\\nnext year he said that it\\'s Russ\\' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\\nend of the season. He feels that they\\'re 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\\n\\nHe\\'s very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\\nfour years if there was a consensus.\\n\\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn\\'t know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\\n\\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\\nall over it.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln\\'t\\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind\\'Amour hustled ahead to\\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\\n\\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn\\'t even swing his\\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\\n\\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\\nset up quickly, but couldn\\'t get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\\nangles...\\n\\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\\n\\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\\n\\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\\n\\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\\n\\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom\\'s 5 hole for his 76th at\\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\\n\\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\\nthe middle. While Brind\\'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek\\'s glove side at 6:44.\\n\\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind\\'Amour and Ledyard went\\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\\nof the season.\\n\\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\\n\\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren\\'t able to pull Hasek as time was running \\nout as the FLYERS wouldn\\'t allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\\ncorner and Brind\\'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\\ngame.\\n\\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn\\'t been tested much\\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don\\'t think so).\\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\\n\\nA couple misc notes:\\n\\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\\n\\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\\n\\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom\\'s medical record and determined that no\\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\\n\\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\\nexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,\\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\\nrole scouting if Farwell didn\\'t want him back.\\n\\nFLYERS team record watch:\\n\\nEric Lindros:\\n\\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\\n\\n(rookie records)\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nEric Lindros\\t40 1992-93\\t\\tDave Poulin\\t76 1983-84\\nBrian Propp\\t34 1979-80\\t\\tBrian Propp\\t75 1979-80\\nRon Flockhart\\t33 1981-82\\t\\tEric Lindros\\t74 1992-93\\nDave Poulin\\t31 1983-84\\t\\tRon Flockhart\\t72 1981-82\\nBill Barber\\t30 1972-73\\t\\tPelle Eklund\\t66 1985-86\\n\\nMark Recchi:\\n\\n52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.\\n\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nReggie Leach\\t61 1975-76\\t\\tMark Recchi\\t121 1992-93*\\nTim Kerr\\t58 1985-86,86-87\\tBobby Clarke\\t119 1975-76\\nTim Kerr\\t54 1983-84,84-85\\tBobby Clarke\\t116 1974-75\\nMark Recchi\\t52 1992-93\\t\\tBill Barber\\t112 1975-76\\nRick Macliesh\\t50 1972-73\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t104 1972-73\\nBill Barber\\t50 1975-76\\t\\tRick Macliesh\\t100 1972-73\\nReggie Leach\\t50 1979-80\\n\\n*More than 80 games.\\n\\nFLYERS career years:\\n\\nPlayer\\t\\tPoints\\tBest Prior Season\\nMark Recchi\\t121\\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\\nRod Brind\\'Amour\\t84\\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\\nGarry Galley\\t62\\t38 (84-85 Kings)\\nBrent Fedyk\\t59\\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\\n\\nThat\\'s all for now...\\n\\tThe garbage started hitting the field well before the Sunday\\ngame.  It started on Thursday or Friday (I can\\'t recall which games I\\n*didn\\'t* watch on TBS).  Deion was getting pelted with trash the whole\\ntime, it seemed.  The announcers talked about the change in the seating\\nin the bleachers, and how that made it easier for the events that\\ntranspired.  I actually thought at the start of the Sunday slugfest that\\nsince it was a Sunday daygame the crowd would be a little different,\\nmore refined.  Surprise?\\nYeah, the news is true...the Leafs lost to the Wings 6-3.\\nWish I could say I\\'d seen the whole game but my husband wanted\\nto watch \"Young Guns II\" on another channel. Sometime between\\nthe first time I tuned in and d saw the Leafs tie and the next time\\nI tuned in and heard the score was 5-1, something happened.\\n\\tPlease no woofing from Red Wings fans.  They\\'re my third\\nfavourite team, and if they make it past the Leafs I\\'ll wish them\\nluck.  As for Potvin...well, it WAS his fist playoff game.\\n\\nHave there ever been any other no-hitters in Mariner history?\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n    I remember reading an article in Reader\\'s digest many moons ago\\n about a similar incident. During a minor leaque game a player neck was\\n cut when the opponent he was back-checking tripped and his skakes\\n flew up. In this case the victim\\'s mask proved a hinderance since\\n his face was protected and so he didn\\'t bother with the\\n usually instinctive reaction to protect his face/neck. A quick        \\n thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using\\n snow to contract the blood vessels (from what I can remember).[...]\\n\\nShouldn\\'t this read \"Braves Hitters are at the AAA Club?\"\\n-- \\nDale J.

Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanaticThis is a general question for US readers:\\n\\nHow extensive is the playoff coverage down there?  In Canada, it is almost\\nimpossible not to watch a series on TV (ie the only two series I have not had\\nan opportunity to watch this year are Wash-NYI and Chi-Stl, the latter because\\nI\\'m in the wrong time zone!).  We (in Canada) are basically swamped with \\ncoverage, and I wonder how many series/games are televised nationally or even\\nlocally in the US and how much precedence they take over, say, local news if\\nthe games go into double-OT.\\n\\nEmail me so as not to waste bandwidth, please.  My news feed is kind of slow\\nanyways.\\nI am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling\\nor perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.\\nHowever, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the\\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \\n\\nIMHO \\nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman\\'s (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman\\'s both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield\\'s). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\\n\\n\\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron\\'s home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n\\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\\nmaking a case for him. \\n\\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\\nbring up his name.\\n\\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don\\'t know I did not\\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\\nthe possible votes.\\n\\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don\\'t belong at least\\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\\n\\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan\\nMaybe - Murray and L. Smith\\nNo - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman\\n\\nAs I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this\\nup - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.\\n\\n: >\\tI loved the ABC coverage.

One complaint I do have about Clement is that he sometimes talks\\ntoo much.  If I wanted that I\\'d listen to Tim McGarver doing a baseball\\ngame.\\n\\n\\nI have one complaint for the cameramen doing the Jersey-Pitt series:  Show\\nthe shots, not the hits.  On more than one occassion the camera zoomed in\\non a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot.  They panned\\nback to show the rebound.  Maybe Mom\\'s camera people were a little more \\nexperienced.\\n\\n\\nHow was this trade bad? I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty\\ngood centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the\\ndeal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the \\nBruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they \\nlost to Montreal (which should please you to no end).

When he bought the team, it seemed kind of\\nobvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red,\\nbefore the team started making a profit again.  He gave the impression\\nthat he was willing to do so.  He claimed two years ago that the team\\nneeded to average only 8000+ fans per game in order to pull a profit,\\nbut this season the team averaged 12000+ fans, despite increasd ticket\\nprices.  I think the team\\'s attendence and play was clearly in an upward\\ntrend, which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in\\ndeciding to move.  He was even offered the many concessions he rudely\\ndemanded, such as guaranteed season ticket sales, cheap rent at the\\nother two arenas in town, etc.\\n\\nOh well, I guess the bottom line is $$$.  Green wanted immediate huge\\nreturns in Dallas, and wasn\\'t willing to wait another year or so in MN. \\nDallas gave Green a pretty stellar deal to play there (although I feel\\nMinnesota\\'s was quite reasonable), and he also has some cronies down\\nthere as well.  All this means, is that Minnesota is without an NHL team\\nfor a year or two.  Too bad for the NHL.\\nThis is incorrect.  This year the Pens had 61 games on \"free\" TV and 6\\ngames on PPV.  Next year they will have 62 games on free TV and 22 on \\na subscription basis.  \\n\\nYou actually get 1 more free game than last year, and there will be no\\nmore \"radio-only\" games.\\n\\nIts a good deal.  Last year, everybody bitched about Baldwin \"breaking\\nup the team\".  Now, he goes out of his way to keep the nucleus of this\\nteam together and that takes money.

People were\\ncheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the\\nentire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning\\nhours with some of the players. Here\\'s a game summary from the St. Louis\\nPost-Disptach. Enjoy...\\n\\nBy Dave Luecking\\nOf The Post-Dispatch Staff:\\n\\nAt 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues\\ngoalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the\\nthe lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than\\nJoseph.\"  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to\\nthe verge of a surprising sweep.\\n\\nJoseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks\\n3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0\\nlead in the best-of-seven series.\\n\\nThe Blackhawks haven\\'t scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second\\nperiod of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds,\\na Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the\\nfirst round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only\\ntwo series the Blues have sweeped in their history.\\n\\nThe Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4,\\na nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had\\nonly two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept\\nPhiladelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.\\n\\nThe shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to\\nmake 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the\\nBlackhawks couldn\\'t touch Joseph.\\n\\nWell, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at \\nevery opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues\\nwere unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.\\n\\nThe Blues\\' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry --\\nwore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game.\\nThe grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and\\nscorers, who made the most of their opportunities.\\n\\nCraig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each\\nperiod. Hull assisted on Janney\\'s first-period power play goal after two unwise\\nChicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull\\'s goal in the second period, and\\nrookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final \\nperiod.\\n\\nBlues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling\\n``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.\" They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour \\n``Bell-Four. Bell-Four.\" They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye.\"\\n\\nSuch talk is a tad premature. There\\'s still one game left, but the Blues are\\non a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.\\n\\nThe Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first\\nminute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan\\ndumped Steve Smith at center ice.\\n\\nChicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray\\'s decision to run into Joseph\\nbackfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.\\n\\nThe Blues didn\\'t get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a\\nscare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to\\nSteve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer\\'s shot and everything else Chicago threw\\nat him in the first period. The \\'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph\\nabout shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph\\'s butterfly\\nstyle is deadly.\\n\\nRookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the\\nperiod -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two\\nshots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues\\' penalty killer twice stole the\\npuck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.\\n \\nMarouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up.\\nHe caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican\\'s third\\npenalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58,\\nand gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu\\nslashed Shanahan.\\n\\nThe Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it\\nwhere he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull\\'s shot hit Belfour\\'s right\\nshoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour\\ndived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into\\nthe net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.\\n\\nThe Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the\\nBlackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds\\nremaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by\\nshooting the puck into the Blues\\' bench.\\n\\nChris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and\\nMarouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues\\'\\npower play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn\\'t return until the midway\\npoint of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased\\nthe Blues\\' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller\\'s crisp pass.\\n\\nTry as they might, the Blackhawks couldn\\'t get to Joseph, who stopped\\neverything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period\\nand 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice.\\n\\nEmerson\\'s goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected\\nFelsner\\'s pass.\\nAlways has been??????\\n\\nEven before he was even conceived of? That\\'s a neat trick.\\n\\nAlways will be??????\\n\\nWe leave a lot of room for error don\\'t we.\\n\\nHopefully I missed an earlier post that this was with regard to otherwise ...\\nwell I leave that to the individual to fill in but I will say what about\\nGehrig!

Otherwise, he just tries to get people out.\\n\\nAs for Clemens, in the Elias Stat Book of 1992, I believe\\nthat Clemens has the best lifetime record for his team, as compared to\\nwhen he doesn\\'t pitch.  How bad would the Red sox have been last year\\nwithout him?  Can you say 92 Phillies?\\n\\nI believe Clemens is the better pitcher because of more power, and hsi\\ngreat tenacity.  Morris is among the guttiest pitchers I;ve ever seen,\\nbut Clemens is in a class with Seaver, Carlton, etc.  Played in Scandinavium, Gothenburg, April 15 1993:\\n ==================================================\\n\\n SWEDEN - FINLAND  6-6 (1-2,3-1,2-3)\\n\\n 1st: SWE 1-0 Peter Popovic      (Markus Naslund)                     6:10\\n      FIN 1-1 Ville Siren        (Keijo Sailynoja)                    8:44 (pp)\\n      FIN 1-2 Juha Riihijarvi    (Timo Saarikoski,Vesa Viitakoski)   13:12 (pp)\\n 2nd: FIN 1-3 Jari Korpisalo     (Kari Harila,Rauli Raitanen)         6:48\\n      SWE 2-3 Jan Larsson        (Mikael Renberg,Stefan Nilsson)      7:25\\n      SWE 3-3 Hakan Ahlund       (Thomas Rundqvist)                   8:56\\n      SWE 4-3 Roger Akerstrom    (Roger Hansson)                      9:13\\n 3rd: SWE 5-3 Stefan Nilsson     (Patrik Juhlin,Charles Berglund)     2:20\\n      FIN 5-4 Keijo Sailynoja                                         9:23\\n      FIN 5-5 Keijo Sailynoja                                         9:44 (ps)\\n      SWE 6-5 Mikael Renberg     (Hakan Ahlund,Thomas Rundqvist)     17:16\\n      FIN 6-6 Jari Korpisalo                                         17:44\\n\\n             Shots on goal:      Penalties:     Attendance:    Referee:\\n Sweden       8 10 10 - 28       5*2min         6,799          Peter Andersson\\n Finland     12 10 11 - 33       6*2min,1*10min                (Sweden)\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n Sweden opened the scoring as Markus Naslund made a drop pass at the Finnish\\n blue line, Popovic picked it up and advanced towards the Finnish goal and\\n shot a nice hard wrist shot in Ketterer\\'s top corner. Ville Siren\\'s slap\\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \\n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since\\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \\n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side.\\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\\n game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\\n\\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best.\\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\\n to try no combinations.\\n\\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\\n Stillman good on defense.\\n Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\\n\\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn\\'t have a very good game, we\\'ve seen him\\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland\\'s starting goalie in the WC.\\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n Starting lines:\\n\\n \\tSWEDEN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFINLAND\\n\\n  35.

If players\\' performance was completely random\\nin (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be\\ngood in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year.\\nWith two years worth of data, you\\'d have 1/4 of the players good each\\nyear, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year.\\nWe have 96 players for 5 years (\\'84-\\'88).  Just flipping a coin, you\\'d\\nexpect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year.\\nThis is what we actually get--\\n\\nNo. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5\\nClutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3\\nCoin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3\\n\\nEssentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years\\nof good performance is the same as what you would get if the process\\nleading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random.\\nIf there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition)\\nthat had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of\\nplayers at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping\\na coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above\\nor below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from \\nthe mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.\\nIn the four years (\\'84-\\'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there\\nwere 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch \\nsituations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of\\nthose 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two\\nyears.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and\\nreally horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process, \\nyou\\'d expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).  \\n\\nEverything that\\'s been measured about clutch hitting over a period\\nof years that could be used to predict any ability with any \\nproposed definition has looked like a random process (with the \\ncaveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage\\nthat could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein \\nprobably never had a \"clutch\" AB against a left-handed pitcher,\\nbut he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would\\nbe a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his \\nplatoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced\\nat casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into \\nstudying it and every one of them, with the exception of the\\nElias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow\\nyou to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better\\nthan flipping a coin.  (Self-serving plug follows:  some of the\\nflaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth-\\ncoming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing.

I\\'m against putting a giant clock (or any size clock\\nfor that matter) up to count down 20 seconds between pitches and\\nthe minute for warm-ups.

But they do have others worth playing, at\\nleast in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.\\n\\n\\nI can believe that.  I\\'m a newbie here, so I\\'ll take your word.  But\\nAlomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.\\nThat is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long\\nas they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a\\nconsensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to\\ngive him that dreaded \"seasoning\".\\n\\n\\nSorry.  New.  Don\\'t know Nichols\\' Law.  Don\\'t believe in catchers\\'\\nera.  But I am interested in pitchers\\' eras with different catchers.\\nAny info on that?\\n\\n\\nIn other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind \\na different decision than we would make must be financial.

You could also be smoking some illegal\\nsubstance.\\n\\n(Hey.  That\\'s a joke.  Don\\'t get offended.  Please.)\\n\\nWell, I can\\'t cite anyone\\'s ethical rectitude because I don\\'t know\\nwhat it means.  :)\\n\\nBut again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it.  Baseball\\nis a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping\\nLopez on the farm then that\\'s what the Braves *should* do.\\n\\nI happen to believe that it\\'s a baseball decision.  While you from\\nyour armchair may disagee, I don\\'t.  I think there is a lot of\\nevidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among\\nlarge guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I\\nthink it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly\\nmore reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have\\nreleased one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It\\nmay also be logical.  I don\\'t know what ethics have to do with it.\\nSeems like pretty good common sense to me.\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow much do you watch and follow hockey?

While a \\'Canadian content\\' rule might be enforcable\\nhere in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US\\nthat the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn\\'t even TRY to push their\\nimport ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.\\n\\nIncreasing the competition for the \\'elite\\' positions, in most cases, would\\nmake players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the\\nlower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some\\nthat play in the AHL, or the IHL where that\\'s an NHL team\\'s primary farm\\nclub, you don\\'t hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on\\nthe secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian\\nplayers in Moncton, but I don\\'t believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.))\\nSo with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players\\nin North America.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the\\nworld.  I\\'ve grown up with Europeans playing on \\'my\\' team, and some of those\\nplayers were the among the best in the world.  From Hedberg, Nilsson, and\\nSjoberg, to Sel{nne, Zhamnov, and Olausson, and all those in between and to\\ncome, I wouldn\\'t have it any other way.\\n\\n\\nI didn\\'t mean that it would necessarily help him improve at that\\nspecific deficiency.  I meant that if having Bonds bat behind him\\ngives Williams (possibly unfounded) confidence, that might translate\\ninto more hitting productivity.  But you\\'re right -- if Williams\\'\\nbiggest problem is more physical than mental, that\\'s less likely\\nto make a difference.\\n\\n\\tThe defenition of the Underdog is a team that has no talent and comes\\nout of nowhere to contend.  The \\'69 Mets and \\'89 Orioles are prime examples,\\nnot the Cubs.  I root for the Cubs, because I feel sorry for them, but \\nbasically they are dogs.  The Pirates today are a great example of an underdog.\\nIf the Rockies and Marlins compete, they will be underdogs.  The North Stars\\ntrip to the Stanley Cup finals was a good example of an underdog\\'s journey. \\nThe Cubs have a good team this year, and play in a weak division, they are much\\nless than America\\'s Team.\\n\\n\\nClemens is going on his normal four days\\' rest (last pitched Saturday). \\nHesketh only pitched one inning yesterday afternoon, his first outing\\nsince an aborted 1-1/3 inning start 6 days before, so he should be plenty\\nrested to go in his expected turn this Saturday, as the 5th starter.  Not\\nthat this is a good thing, of course.  I\\'d like to see a well-managed\\nfour-man rotation with this team... \\n\\n---\\nGlenn Waugaman\\nDigital Equipment Corporation\\nLittleton, MA\\ng_waugaman@nac.enet.dec.comSince everyone else seems to be running wild with predictions, I\\'ve\\ndecided to add my own fuel to the fire:\\nThey might seem a bit normal, but there are a few (albeit, small) surprises.\\n\\nAmerican League East\\t W\\t L\\tGB\\n1)New York Yankees\\t93\\t69\\t--\\n2)Baltimore Orioles\\t90\\t72\\t 3\\n3)Toronto Blue Jays\\t86\\t76\\t 7\\n4)Cleveland Indians     84      78       9\\n5)Boston Red Sox\\t77\\t85\\t16\\n6)Milwaukee Brewers\\t74\\t88\\t19\\n7)Detroit Tigers\\t73\\t89\\t20\\n\\nAmerican League West\\t W\\t L\\tGB\\n1)Minnesota Twins\\t94\\t68\\t--\\n2)Kansas City Royals\\t92\\t70\\t 2\\n3)Texas Rangers     \\t85\\t77\\t 9\\n4)Chicago White Sox\\t77\\t85\\t17\\n5)Oakland Athletics\\t74\\t88\\t20\\n6)Seattle Mariners\\t70\\t92\\t24\\n7)California Angels\\t65\\t97\\t29\\n\\nAL MVP-Kirby Puckett\\nAL Cy Young-Kevin Appier\\nAL Rookie of the Year-Tim Salmon\\nAL Manager of the Year-Buck Showalter\\nAL Comeback Player of the Year-Ozzie Guillen\\n\\nNational League East\\t W\\t L\\tGB\\n1)St. Louis Cardinals\\t91\\t71\\t--\\n2)Philadelphia Phillies 89\\t73\\t 2\\n3)Montreal Expos\\t88\\t74\\t 3\\n4)New York Mets\\t\\t84\\t78\\t 7\\n5)Chicago Cubs\\t\\t79\\t83\\t12\\n6)Pittsburgh Pirates\\t73\\t89\\t18\\n7)Florida Marlins\\t54     108\\t37\\n\\nNational League West\\t W\\t L\\tGB\\n1)Atlanta Braves\\t96\\t66\\t--\\n2)Cincinnati Reds\\t94\\t68\\t 2\\n3)Houston Astros\\t89\\t73\\t 7\\n4)Los Angeles Dodgers\\t82\\t80\\t14\\n5)San Francisco Giants\\t81\\t81\\t15\\n6)San Diego Padres\\t75\\t87\\t21\\n7)Colorado Rockies\\t59     103\\t37\\n\\nNL MVP-Barry Larkin\\nNL Cy Young-John Smoltz\\nNL Rookie of the Year-Wil Cordero\\nNL Manager of the Year-Joe Torre\\nNL Comeback Player of the Year-Eric Davis\\n\\nNL Champions-St. Louis Cardinals\\nAL Champions-Minnesota Twins\\nWorld Champions-St. Louis Cardinals\\n\\nThe St. Louis picks are what my heart says.\\nWhat my brain says, is they will win the division, lose to the Braves\\nin the NLCS, and the Braves will win the Series against Minnesota.\\nBut for now, I\\'ll stick with the Cards all the way.Newsgroups: rec.sport.baseball\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry talks about this \"incident\" in his autobiography \"Holy Cow.\"  \\nUnfortunately, I can not clarify on this since (1) I read the book a couple\\nof years ago and (2) I do not have my book with me.  \\n\\nAnyway, It is a pretty interesting book if you are a Harry or Cubs fan.I was on vacation all last week and didn\\'t see any news at all.

Delino Deshields thinks he is. \\nFor your information, Lankford is injured (I think it is his shoulder or rib\\ncage), so he could not use him as a pinch hitter.\\n \\nI do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does\\nnot have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively.\\nSince when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:)\\nI forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.\\n \\nAs far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who\\nbeat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.\\n \\nI agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that\\nLankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make\\na perfect throw?\\n \\nI strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don\\'t\\nforget the overachieving Cards of \\'91 that won all those close games and went\\nfrom last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/\\nTwins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant\\nrace when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I\\nwill never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading\\nin the right direction.\\n \\nOne more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds,\\nbut with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the\\nEast), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they\\nlose.

The player must be \\nperiodically re-evaluated to determine if he\\'s still injured (thus you \\ncannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not \\nwish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day \\nthat reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I \\nbelieve, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.

Just wondering.\\n\\nit was meant entirely, 100%, as a compliment.\\n\\n} I do this as a service to the entire baseball world on USENET, especially\\n} for those in the East Coast who can\\'t get final scores for West Coast games\\n} in their newspapers or late TV newscasts. This is helpful to fans in other\\n} countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week. Also,\\n} many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only\\n} available through BBS\\'s or some pay news services. By the way, mine is free\\n} of charge and has no copyright restrictions.\\n\\ni was not trying to criticize your service at all.\\nin fact, i was trying to encourage others to use it.\\ni don\\'t personally use it, but i\\'m sure others do, and that was my point in\\nposting--there is no need for individuals to duplicate, in an ad hoc fashion,\\nwhat you have already organized.\\n \\n} >if you want to send updates and scores, set up a private mailing list\\n} >and use that.\\n} \\n} Remember I only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the\\n} rec.sport.baseball newsgroup. Other than that, everything is done through\\n} private e-mail. Currently, there are 986 people on my mailing list that\\n} branches off into other mailing lists available for many others. And the list\\n} grows by an average of 35 people a day.\\n\\nhaving one person, such as yourself, who does it, is a great idea.\\nhaving 100 do it is not. that\\'s all.\\n\\nkeep up the good work, Joseph.\\n\\nAre you comparing Cullen to Salami?  I would say that that is valid.  If\\nWinnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does Salami\\nstand around the other team\\'s blueline when the puck is in his own end?\\n\\n\\n\\nExcuse me?  Are the Jets playing .500 hockey?  Let me check...yes - but just\\nbarely.  They have allowed more goals than they have scored.  Sounds an\\nawful lot like Salami\\'s +/- to me.  Sounds like they would be just as well\\noff - or better - if he played the solid two-way game that our friends in\\nFinland claim he is capable of.  But if he did that he wouldn\\'t be chal-\\nlenging for the league lead in goals would he?  The Bi-Planes might be\\nchallenging for first however...\\n\\n\\nNow let\\'s see...you have compared Timo to Anderson and Cullen.  Who\\'s\\nnext?  Mike Foligno?\\n\\n\\n\\nSome of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he\\ncan play a solid two-way game.  I would have to say that this style\\nof contribution would be more conducive to winning.  Or don\\'t you \\nthink so?\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t believe it!  You did compare him to Foligno!  (And I honestly hadn\\'t\\nread this far).\\n\\nIt would help if you used a little discrimination in your thinking.  Your\\ncontributions would be more highly valued if we could see that you weren\\'t\\ntrying to be merely argumentative.\\n\\ncordially, as always,\\n\\nrm\\nCurrent votes for favorite goalie masks (3pts - 1st, 2pts - 2nd, 1pt - 3rd)\\n\\nPlayer                    Team                 Pts       Votes\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n1.

I\\nremember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my\\nguess he was wearing the exact same duds.  \\n\\tThe Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC\\'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have\\nreinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets\\ninsgnia on the front of the jersey.

The trend has also\\nseen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the\\nearly years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums\\nconstrucrted throughout the sixties.\\n\\tWith salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one\\nin the comissioner\\'s office, and inter-league play on the\\nhorizon, it\\'s nice to see that baseball at least looks like it\\nwas meant to be. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat last was me, Steve Novak.  I\\'ve since read the entire original\\nposting by Hite.\\n\\nMr. Fischer was actually restrained.  Let Mr. Hite hope he never makes\\nsome similar, tiny mistake.\\nBy Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff\\n\\nAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.\\nTheir cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of\\n17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to\\nthe playoff-bound Blues.\\n\\nThe scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.\\nWith the North Stars\\' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the\\nfinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit\\nplaying.\\n\\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\\nTampa\\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\\nsupervisor John D\\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\\n\\n``I\\'m glad I didn\\'t see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\\n\\nIf the goal had counted, he\\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\\'\\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\\nthe playoffs tempered Berry\\'s anger.\\n\\n``It wasn\\'t pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\\'t have, but\\nit did.\"\\n\\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\\'s end.\\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\\nChicago Stadium.\\n\\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\\n\\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\\n\\n``It\\'s a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\\'d have kept working, it would have\\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\\n\\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\\n``We won, and that\\'s all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\\n\\nSome players didn\\'t have a problem.\\n\\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\\'t quit,\" said Rich\\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\\ncan\\'t allow five goals like we did, that\\'s not right.\\n\\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\\n\\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\\' effort. Somehow,\\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\\'s loss.\\n\\n``I didn\\'t know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\\nbench. I didn\\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\\'re in the playoffs,\\nand that\\'s great, but it\\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\\nend.\"\\n\\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\\n\\n``I told them I didn\\'t want to see the score, I didn\\'t want to know the score,\"\\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\\'s the approach we took.\"\\n\\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\\n\\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\\n\\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\\n\\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\\n\\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \\nrebound of Bret Hedican\\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\\n\\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\\n\\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He\\'s in heaven now, and\\nI know he was watching. I know he\\'s happy.\"\\n\\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\\'s shutout just 18 seconds\\nlater, making it 5-1.\\n\\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\\n\\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\\nperiod.\\n\\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\\'s second goal stand up as the\\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\"\\nAnd Fleury is no enforcer. An agitator for sure, but Fleury never has and never\\nwill have a fight, which seems to be what you\\'re saying Wood is. \\n\\nThe closest Fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against\\nLos Angeles. There was a scrum and McSorley pinched Fleury\\'s head under his\\narm. Fleury dropped his gloves and gave McSorley a weak shot to the side of the\\nhead. McSorely, knowing a good thing when he saw one, popped Fleury one right\\nbetween the eyes. End of fight. Fleury got ten stitches for his trouble.\\n\\nThe only player I can ever see Theo fighting is Cliff Ronning, and even then\\nhe\\'d be giving up two inches and 10-15 pounds. :-)\\n-\\n- I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton.\\n- Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference\\n- next week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed\\n- to concern the Oiler\\'s future.\\n-\\n- Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement\\n- with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,\\n- Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that\\n- the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to\\n- renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.\\n-\\n- Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,\\n- but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.\\n-\\n- As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly\\n- supportive of the Oilers. Even though they\\'re a small market\\n- team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems\\n- that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans\\n- than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if\\n- the team does move, there is no place more deserving than\\n- Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand\\n- realignment scheme of Bettman?\\n-\\n\\n  Following up on this, the provincial government has been asked by the\\nOpposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton.  The\\ngovernment said that Pock is going nowhere!\\n\\n  Why don\\'t I believe the government?  Wasn\\'t it Pocklington who wanted to be\\nTory leader 9 years ago?\\n\\tViola has only played in the NL with the Mets -- not possible for him\\nto have defeated or lost to every team.  Ditto for Tanana who was mentioned\\nin a previous post.\\n\\n\\n\\tI don\\'t remember if Seaver managed to get a win against the White Sox\\nin his brief sojourn with Boston so I\\'d say the other pitcher to defeat every\\nteam is either Mike Torrez (he bounced around enough for a long enough period\\nof time) or Koosman as mentioned.

Both teams seemed a bit tense in the\\nopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got\\ninto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-\\nstanding team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record\\ntheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on\\npenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play \\nand could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had\\ntheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10\\ntries.\\n\\nThe Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the\\nblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the \\nFlames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-\\npected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse\\nin his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to \\nthe dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this \\nmorning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.\\n\\n1st period: \\n1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won\\nthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the\\npuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the\\nfar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He\\nput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up\\nin \\'his office\\', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where\\nSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the \\nhash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.\\n\\nMillen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings\\nfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.\\nDahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30\\nsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in\\nthe period.\\n\\n2nd period: \\nThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed\\nto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into\\nthe stands and received a delay of game.\\n\\n1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the\\npuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit \\nthe stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated \\ndown the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and\\nskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him \\nand he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.\\n\\n2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.\\nShuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed\\nfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot \\nwhere 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson\\ncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot\\nbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.\\n\\n3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off\\nthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass\\ncross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,\\nbeating a diving Vernon on the glove side.\\n\\n4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the\\nnear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his\\nown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low\\nslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.\\n\\nSkrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at\\n12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they\\nfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive\\npower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high\\nsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The\\nKings hit 3 goal post in the period.\\n\\n3rd period:\\nThe Kings used the phrase \"Initiate, not retaliate\" and it was very evident here\\nin the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames \\ncontinued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.\\n\\n5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot\\nthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to\\ncut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,\\nwacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the\\ncrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net\\nwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.\\n\\nSydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.\\n\\n5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net\\nand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the \\ncrease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.\\n\\nCarson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury\\ntripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where \\nFleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing \\na 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the \\nKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at \\n8:19) took penalties.  \\n\\n5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near \\npoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the\\nnet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of\\nHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.\\n\\n6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play\\nto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone \\ncut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed \\nthe puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, \\nbeating Vernon on the ice, stick side.\\n\\nAt the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he\\nwent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single\\nminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames\\nright out of the game.\\n\\nOn the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey\\nas they let Calgary retaliate.

I am astounded at\\nthe number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only\\ndon\\'t understand but publicly admit to not understanding. In fact, there\\'s a\\nplausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins.\\n\\nFor the record, there are two ways that a reliever can get a save:\\nHe must finish the game and either\\n1. have entered the game with the tying run on base, at bat, or on deck.\\n2. have pitched at least three innings effectively.\\nA pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game.\\n\\n\\nBut this is an argument that *wins* is a dumb stat, not saves.\\n\\n\\nThis again doesn\\'t support your claim about saves at the beginning of your\\npost. \\n\\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\\nLinares has not defected; as I pointed out, MLB requires that the player\\ndefect first.\\n\\n\\nWhat a surprise.  As long as the pool of talent is not accessible to all\\nteams, MLB won\\'t let a few teams sign it.  Seems perfectly reasonable to\\nme.  \\n\\n\\nExcept that MLB won\\'t allow it, which is all I ever said.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t buy this at all.  I think things are colored to a very large\\ndegree of preconceived notions of who the players involved are.  Try\\nthis exercise:\\n\\nXXX is pitching today.  His team scores 4 in the first inning, and 3\\nin the fourth.  XXX gives up 0 in the 1st through 4th.  In the fifth,\\nhe gives up 3 runs.  In the 6th, he gives up 2 more.  The score is now\\n7-5, with XXX\\'s team still on top.\\n\\nI contend that if XXX were Jack Morris, the assessment would be \"he is\\na gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win.\"\\n\\nIf XXX were Mike Trmbley, the assessment would be \"he is an\\ninexperienced rookie who doesn\\'t know how to pitch.  Needs more\\nseasoning.  Send him to AAA.  Or to the spice rack.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt depends.  If you can get your old veterans cheap, and if they can perform\\nat a higher level than your young talent can *now*, why not the talent \\ndevelop in the minors while giving the fans some familiar names to cheer.\\nIf the veterans are gone in a year or two -- that should be just about right.\\n\\n\\nOpen question -- which was more important to the expansion clubs, the expansion\\ndraft or the regular draft.  (They\\'ve had one of each, I think.)\\n-- \\nDale J.

The post (which, though\\nhaving pretty much the same content, is an entirely different entity) was\\naddressed to all.  When she puts the letter in the mail I doubt it will\\nsay \"To: All\".  I figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it\\nsince it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here.  That\\'s an entirely \\ndifferent purpose than sending the letter to Bettman.\\n\\nUnfortunately...\\n\\n\\n\\nThe \"largest computer networks in the world\" phrase is a definition of \\nthe Internet, not a group as a whole that she claims to represent.  As\\nfor the business of whether or not it is large, it is large compared\\nto say, the number of folks on r.s.h. who are sending a letter to thank\\nhim for changing the names, at least to this point.  And just for my\\nown curiosity I thought I\\'d look up the \"official\" definition of large\\nin the dictionary.  It reads:\\n\\nlarge - 1.  having more than usual power, capacity, or scope.    \\n        2.  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size.\\n\\nNow I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue\\nor how many people may have signed them.  65 people may be up there, \\nthereby validating definition 2.  I would also wager that the geographical\\nrange of signatures is quite large, which would give it a large scope.\\n\\n\\nWhy would he be impressed with this unless it were \"large\"? \\n\\nI am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing\\nand are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear\\nyourself speak.  \\n\\nI personally don\\'t know whether or not I agree with the letter.  I have\\nvery mixed emotions about it.  I like the names as they are, and don\\'t\\nthink they make it that difficult to learn the game, but there might be\\na shred of validity to the change.  \\nLast night, Boston Red Sox win its 11 games of 14 games by beating Seattle\\n5-2.

Any reason given for this?\\n\\nAlso, I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in\\nthe preview. On 8/22/89, Rickey Henderson became Nolan\\'s 5000th strikeout.\\nOn 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the\\nlast out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan\\npitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his\\n939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of\\npublicity at Rickey\\'s expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as\\nmost of the net agrees with me from what I\\'ve seen on it lately. They are\\nboth great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playing\\nand more importantly, in attitude. Just my thoughts.I forgot to mention that the stats are for games through 4/20.OK, I\\'ll join in the fun and give my playoff predictions: \\n\\n1st round: \\n----------\\n\\nPITT vs NYI:  PITT in 4.  \\nWASH vs NJD:  WASH in 6. \\n\\nBOS  vs BUF:  BOS  in 5. \\nQUE  vs MON:  MON  in 7. \\n\\nCHI  vs STL:  CHI in 4. \\nDET  vs TOR:  DET in 6. \\n\\nVAN  vs WIN:  WIN in 6. \\nCAL  vs  LA:  CAL in 5. \\n\\n2nd round: \\n----------\\n\\nPITT vs WASH: PITT in 4. \\nBOS  vs MON:  BOS  in 6. \\n\\nCHI  vs DET:  CHI  in 7. \\nWIN  vs CAL:  CAL  in 5. \\n\\n3rd round: \\n----------\\n\\nPITT vs BOS:  PITT in 5. \\nCHI  vs CAL:  CHI  in 5. \\n\\nFinals:\\n------\\n\\nPITT vs CHI: PITT in 5. \\nDo the Isles have another defenseman to insert into the line-up besides\\nPilon???

Randy Graca seems to think Murray is the best GM in the league.\\nI think Quinn is one of several who are better.\\n\\n\\nWhen Quinn took over Vancouver- several years ago, NOT LAST YEAR, they \\nregularily missed the playoffs.  I can\\'t recall if they missed the playoffs\\nthe year before his hiring but they probably did.  Quinn has improved the\\nteam from non-playoff calibre to a serious contender.\\n\\nWhen Murray took over in Detroit, the were about a .500 team that was a\\ncontender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup\\ncontender.\\n\\nSo Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM.\\nQuinn is one example of a better GM than Murray.I don\\'t know if anyone has posted a message like this yet, but i\\'m\\ngetting really sick of espn showing the last minute of a hockey\\ngame, in which the score was just tied, and then cutting out and saying\\n\"sorry we can\\'t show you this we have to show baseball tonight\" (not\\neven a game. a friggin HIGHLIGHT show).\\ngee, sure would have been nice to see the isles/caps in overtime.\\nI live in Pittsburgh (yes i\\'m a pens fan) where hockey gets a lot\\nof coverage.  i can only imagine how a caps fan residing in Texas\\nmust feel.\\n\\nOh yeah, how come Dino could never take the Caps out of the Patrick\\nDivision?  He choked up 3 games to 1 last year and got swept away in\\nthe second round two years ago.

I remember one time last year he was being interviewed by\\nESPN, and the interviewer (can\\'t remember who), asked Stanky if he was\\nJewish because he (the interviewer) was Jewish and wanted to see more\\nJewish ballplayers. To which Stanky replied, \"I\\'m Polish, not Jewish.\"\\n\\nSo maybe that wasn\\'t the most PC thing for Stanky to say, and maybe I was\\na little naive when I posted it. I think we should just devote this\\nsubject to finding actual Jewish ballplayers (I myself am Jewish and the\\nonly ones I ever knew until now were Koufax, Greenberg, and Blomberg).\\n\\nAnd you wrote an *excellent* report about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered\\nexpendable by the A\\'s when he refused to accept any coaching about\\nhis batting stance.  The A\\'s brain trust came to believe that his\\nback problems were exacerbated, if not caused, by having a wide open\\nstance, closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque\\n(that\\'s a paraphrase of what I remember).\\n\\nIn any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide\\nhis stance, and the A\\'s began to believe that he would either reinjure\\nhimself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApparently, you sound like LaRussa.\\n\\n\\nThe A\\'s also objected about this.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain, I\\'m just repeating something I heard.  But possibly the cause\\nand effect is the reverse of that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\nAfter reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that\\nMilwaukee should have an NHL team, I thought I\\'d pass along a story I heard\\nrecently.  This is second hand, so I don\\'t know how true it is, but I have\\nno reason to doubt it either.\\n\\nBradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge\\nhockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can\\'t remember his name)\\neither owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the\\nBradley Center.\\n\\nSupposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but \\nturned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too\\nhigh.\\n\\nLike I said, I don\\'t know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if\\nit\\'s true, don\\'t look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals\\naren\\'t going to be forced out of the building and you won\\'t see an NHL club\\nand a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA\\'s\\nMilwaukee Bucks play there as well.The original poster wanted to know how the Big Cat looked. I was also at\\nthe Saturday game in Montreal (Apr 17) that Rockies won 9-1. I haven\\'t\\npaid much attention to Gallarraga since he left the Expos but his stance\\nseemed to be MUCH different. He stands more erect and very open, with his\\nleft foot pointing to 3rd base. I\\'m wondering if this is a recent change\\nin stance for him? Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter. He could\\nalways be fooled by a curve ball low and away. If this is indeed a new\\nstance for him, maybe he is not being fooled as easily? As for his patience,\\n\\nDennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff. If he was grooving\\npitches to Andres, you can hardly fault him for drilling them (which he did!).\\nDoes Andres generally start hot or cold? Does it take until May for most\\npitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away?I would like to make everyone aware that in winning the NL West the Atlanta\\nBraves did not lead wire-to-wire.  Through games of 4/14/93 the Houston\\nAstros are percentage points ahead of the \"unbeatable\" Braves.\\n\\n\\nGo Astros!!!!!\\nbleagh! this was a terrific trade.  snow will certainly be better than\\nmattingly in the future, but that they\\'ll be about the same now is a\\ndefensible opinion.  abbott is one of the few truly great pitchers in\\nthe game today.\\n\\n\\ni\\'m not sure about this one.  i think that it\\'s good, in that a\\npre-1992 boggs kicks hayes/meulens/whoevers\\' ass, and that a 1992\\nboggs still isn\\'t ALL that shabby.  it\\'s bad, though, that the\\nyankees expect a pre-1992 boggs, and will probably get a 1992 boggs.\\nhowever, i\\'d still play boggs over hayes or bam bam.\\n\\n\\nyou have my full agreement here.  he\\'s not all that much better than\\nvelarde, and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him.\\nhowever, i do enjoy the fact that \"spike\" is not a nickname.\\nnot that this helps the yankees.\\n\\n\\ni strongly disagree.  i\\'d much much rather have a hundred games of\\ntartabull and sixty games of dion james than 162 games of james.\\nHi guys....\\n\\nWhat happened?\\n\\t1.  Potvin didn\\'t let six goals by.\\n\\t2.  Wendel and Andreychuk woke up.\\n\\t3.  Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs\\n\\t\\tthe emotional edge.\\n\\t4.  Refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour Leafs.\\n\\n\\tA couple of comments:\\n\\n\\t1.  On Gilmour:  Just because the guy isn\\'t one of the three\\n\\tstars doesn\\'t mean he was not leading the team.  Someone posted\\n\\tthe playoff point total and he\\'s in something like fifth or sixth\\n\\tplace....plus, he walked away with the Molson cup (given for\\n\\taccumulating points from the three star selection) during the\\n\\tregular season.\\n\\n\\t2.  On the officiating:  I\\'ve heard gripes from both ends on this\\n\\tone.  Emotions are very high in this series;  the rivalry is\\n\\tone of the stronger ones I know of.  I do have to agree that the\\n\\tofficiating last night was pro-Leaf in general (except for whoever\\n\\tmissed that slash on Gilmour\\'s hand).\\n\\n\\t3.  In general:  I STILL think Detroit has one of the better\\n\\tchances vs. Pittsburgh (though I think the Leafs would do better\\n\\tagainst the Blues....but not as well if they made it out of the\\n\\tdivision). Problem is, I like both these teams, though I\\'m\\n\\tsupporting the Leafs on the underdog principle.  D\\n\\n\\tBy the way...Gilmour tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not\\n\\t\\tplaying aggressive hockey....\\n\\tBy the way....I\\'m not any sort of expert, nor do I claim to be.\\n\\t\\tI just like watching a good matchup.\\n\\n\\nThe Selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals\\nfrom being scored- not to score them.  When Lemieux or Gilmour play their\\nnumber one purpose is to score- defence is secondary- especially considering\\nthe line that plays against them is probably a defensive one.  That is\\nwhy they are not Selke candidates.\\n\\n\\nSomeone posted something about this assumption being lost in translation\\n(it was a few months ago).  Whoever this was please repost it.\\n\\n\\nGainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment.\\nHe was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you\\never watch him play? He never made a technical error.\\n\\n<Babbling deleted>\\n\\n\\nWho are these pundits??  Gilmour was good with St Louis- but he was not the\\nbest two-way player in the game when he was with them.  You have overhyped\\nGilmour on this net for months.  He is a very good forward- but hardly the\\nbest in the NHL.\\nNot an astute observation -- this is a straw-bullpen.  The lefties,\\nStanton & Mercker are strong, and Wohlers is down learning a new pitch.\\nThe bullpen is fine, probably superior.\\n\\n\\nAlso false.  Gant, Nixon, Justice, Hunter, Blauser present a decent enough\\noffense.  EVERYONE is slumping (except Blauser), not just Pendleton.\\n\\nBTW, what is the story with Brian Hunter?  Is he in the dog house?Come on Boston, where the hell are you? Seven wins in a row and what, choke?\\n\\nI\\'d much rather see the Bruins in the Wales Conference finals vs. Pitt than\\nBuffalo or Quebec, if only because it would be more interesting.  Not that\\nBuffalo or Quebec can\\'t put up a good fight, but I\\'d much more enjoy a 7-0\\npasteing of the Bruins than the Devils.  You have to feel for Terrerri(sp?).Everyone... Read this.  If you have already sent your predictions, please\\ncorrect the Patrick division if you would like.

C\\'mon, I\\'m a Boston\\nfan and I even realize that Chicago-Detroit games are THE most exciting\\ngames to watch.\\nWalt Weiss tripled just barely inside the right field line and into the\\ncorner, driving in Santiago and Conine.  These were the first two\\nRBIs.  The third came later when Weiss was knocked in.\\n\\nWell, it looks like, just as Doug trumped Tim, beating him to the net\\nwith his defensive analyses, so Tim has gotten in ahead of me.\\n\\nThe way I was doing it was a little different. Being me, of course, I\\nused equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,\\nand I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent\\naverage) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I\\ncompared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and\\nhere\\'s why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the\\nsystem. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above\\nreplacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;\\n1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks\\nsubstantially right.\\n\\nIn the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I\\nhad decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of\\n.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is\\n\"Billy Ripken\". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the\\nsame distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I\\nhave set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs\\nare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared\\nand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded\\noff for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:\\nRandy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo\\nGomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)\\nin left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.\\n\\nSo, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and\\nfielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of\\nbatting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55,\\n30 batting, 25 fielding.\\n\\nTotal RAR (bat/field)\\n\\n1. Bonds      152 (124/28)  Ventura    124 (66/58)\\n2.

A \"reasonable\" umpire would have realized that\\nthere was a 1-run game in progress, with two outs in the ninth.  What\\nRon Gant did was try to regain his composure.  What a \"normal\" baseball\\nplayer would have done would have been to get into a heated argument\\nwith the umpire, and since you can\\'t argue balls and strikes, he would\\nhave been ejected from the game.  Ron Gant, by trying to avoid such a\\nconflict, was penalized for showing some restraint.\\n\\n\\tIncidentally, a \"reasonable\" home plate umpire would not have been\\nso resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire, as Gant\\nrequested.  If the home plate umpire had appealed to first, the first base\\numpire could have wrung up the strike, and Gant would not have been so\\nupset.  If the call had been a ball, and the catcher had requested the\\nappeal, it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help.\\n\\n\\tFinally, the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the so-called\\nefforts to \"speed up the game.\"  The game was played very quickly, it was\\njust at 2 hours when the stuff happened in the ninth, and the only delays\\nin the entire game had been *the result* of actions by the umpires (other than\\nDeion having to clean garbage off the field).\\n\\n\\nI\\'m totally p*-o\\'d, too!  Vancouver-Winnipeg is great west-coast hockey -\\nfast-paced and loads of talent.  What I\\'ve seen so far is hardly\\nentertaining, with the exception of the odd shift every now & then (of\\ncourse I missed Calgary-LA & Pitts-Jersey...)\\n\\n\\nAmen...\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s cheaper than what I do - PHONE CALLS.

Last time I checked, Jim Fregosi was still managing the\\nPhillies, and doing quite a fine job thank you...best record in\\nbaseball at 8-1\\n\\nMY PREDICTION FOR 1993:\\nJim Fregosi will win manager of the year in the NL\\n: That\\'s not inner calm.  It\\'s boredom, and it\\'s being spoiled.  The Arena\\'s\\n: been as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just\\n: take winning for granted.  It\\'s been seemingly forever since the team\\n: lost, and we\\'ve forgotten what it\\'s like to feel real excitement and\\n: surprise at victory.\\n\\nAt least last night there was some excitement. The Pens \\ndidn\\'t have it wrapped up before the game was half over like \\nthe previous two games. I\\'m not sure if NJ just rose up and \\nplayed better or if the Penguins just started to play down \\nsomewhat. Probably it was somewhere in between. New Jersey \\nseemed much more aggressive last night in the Pens end. They \\ndid much more swarming around, which at least kept an \\nelement of suspense in the game. No question that Billington \\nhelped make it more interesting also. Claude Lemieux didn\\'t \\nhelp the cause any though, with his ejection early in the \\ngame. So, who\\'s going to start in the Devils goal for the \\n\"final\" game Sunday? ;-) Sorry. I couldn\\'t help myself.\\nDavid\\n\\n\\nHey man! -\\n\\nHaving spent the past season learning to skate and having played a\\ncouple of sessions of mock hockey, I\\'m ready to invest in hockey\\nequipment (particularly since I will be taking summer \\'hockey\\nlessons\\').  However, I am completely and profoundly ignorant when it\\ncomes to hockey equipment.  I\\'ve checked out local stores and looked\\nat catalogs, but I was hoping to solicit opinions/suggestions before\\nactually plunking down any money.  Having played football in high\\nschool and college I at least have that equipment as a basis for\\ncomparison.  But for example what are the advantages/disadvantages to\\ndifferent kinds of shoulder pads and pants/girdles?  Are there any\\nnotoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles?  etc.  So any suggestions\\nor comments would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n > Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 2-0 in\\n > their entire 68-year history.\\n\\n   Which doesn\\'t mean much since the statistics are mostly based on\\nthe 5-game playoff format. But, yes, it looks dark for the B\\'s. What a\\ndisappointment.\\n\\n   Still, I think the problem is mental. They needed the saves Blue\\ncame up with, perhaps he can offer something to mentally rally around.\\n\\n   Who do you think gets the start in game three? I hope it is going\\nto be Blue. If the team can rally around him, maybe Moog can too.\\n\\nYou, along with Mario Lemieux, must be from another planet.  The only\\ndifference is that Lemieux comes from the one with Geo. Washington, Abe\\nLincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come\\nfrom the one with David Koresh.  Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties,\\nbut wouldn\\'t you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team\\nan advantage?  I don\\'t remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this\\nyear, whereas many others did.  Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about\\nbeing hit.  He knows it\\'s part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an\\neven bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting\\nthem up.)  Don\\'t you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so\\nmuch in his life?There is a correction to the note I posted for today\\'s update:\\n\\nThis is how it read:\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nOf course, last Saturday was April 17th.

Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to\\nthis:\\n  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.\\n  -- Can\\'t bring myself to pick the Yankees\\n  -- Milwaukee was a fluke\\n  -- Indians aren\\'t ready to contend\\n  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn\\'t get any better\\n  -- Detroit\\'s pitching will be the new definition of \"replacement level\"\\n\"But you don\\'t really think the Orioles will win, do you.\"  No.  As a matter\\nof fact, I can\\'t see any team in the American League winning either division\\non paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-\\nbody has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \"You don\\'t really think that Brady\\nAnderson is going to repeat, do you?\"  No.  I\\'m basing the Orioles prediction\\non the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \"Glenn\\nDavis?  That\\'s insane\".  Yes.  So, without further ado:\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.\\nWEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be\\n  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.\\n  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize\\n  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can\\'t move Ripken out of the #3\\n  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.\\nObPrediction:  \"The Streak\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in\\n  caught stealing.\\n\\n2. New York Yankees.\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American\\n  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.\\nWEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner \\n  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far\\n  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to\\n  win a division.\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.\\nObPrediction:  Mattingly won\\'t top a 700 OPS.\\n\\n3.  Toronto Blue Jays\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie\\n  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.\\n  Guzman.  Alomar.\\nWEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.\\n  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that\\'s *really* a bad sign).  No one in\\n  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.\\nObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.

Cleveland Indians\\nSTRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy\\nWEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix\\n  Fermin.\\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki\\'s ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.\\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.\\nObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.\\n\\n6.

Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanaticHere we are with the Sabres up 2-0 to the Bruins and the Sabres\\' farm\\nteam, the Rochester Amerks, on their way to the Calder Cup (urp!) and\\nwhat kind of hockey coverage are we getting? The same Penguins/Devils\\nevery other day crap that everyone else gets. What\\'s worse, the\\nSportsChannel coverage of the Islanders appears to be blocked out,\\nsince we got CBA basketball last night, if you can believe it.  I\\nassume the Sabres are demanding the SC blackout, not ESPN, since we\\nare, unbelievably, usually considered part of the Islanders territory\\n(MSG coverage of the Rangers is blacked out here). This despite being\\na solid seven hours plus from Long Island.\\n\\nDoes anyone know what GRC is doing, besides putting their satellite\\ndish up their ass and screwing my reception of channels 8, 10, and 13?\\nDid Empire demand a fortune for the games? What about the games on\\nFox37 (or whatever number it is there in Buffalo)? Has anyone phoned\\nto complain (besides me)?\\n\\nGeorge\\n\\nMy apologies for the typo - I meant the Wings had 5 power plays in the\\nfirst period and the Leafs none.  \\n\\nAs well, my point isn\\'t that the refs were biased, just that they were\\ncalling a lot of penalties, which works to the benefit of the Wings.\\n\\nHaving the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then\\ncalling a bunch against the other to \"make up for it\" takes a lot away\\nfrom what could have been a great game.\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the A\\'s conditioning\\nguru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help\\nhis back.Although I don\\'t for one second believe Jose used steroids,his\\nback problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience\\nbecause they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame(see Jeff\\nBregel ex 49er as a textbook example), and IMHO Jose is too big for his\\nframe.\\n\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that\\nJose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with\\nthe A\\'s, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back\\nproblems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance\\ncaused, but now he\\'s lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts\\nhim. The old saying if you\\'re hot its a trigger mechanism, if you\\'re\\ncold, its a hitch. \\n\\n\\nThe biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he\\'s comfortable\\nwith for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses\\ntrack of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday\\'s night game, he was \\nclearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to\\nme. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because\\nhe\\'s changed his stance so much.\\n\\nI\\'m also a bit concerned that because he\\'s got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting\\nall the homeruns, he\\'ll become competitive, swing even harder and screw\\nhimself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco\\'s famous batting\\npractice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged\\nbad hitting habits.\\n\\n\\nBelieve it or not, we DO have phone books, but the current information does\\nnot include an area code for Edmonton Alberta.\\n\\nI would not be so hostile towards others for asking simple questions...\\n\\n\"I would rather appear stupid than open my moutha nd remove all doubt.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t-Mark Twain\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\"If you assult someone you get 5 years--In hockey, 5 minutes.\\n\\t\\t\\tIs this a great sport or what?!\"Wow, this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team, Boston.\\nWhich Sweeney you ask...well, of course Bob Sweeney, the one that Boston\\nlet Buffalo get a hold of (they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes things\\nslightly confusing).  Game winner in OT in game 1, and another\\nBIG goal (seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why\\nGrant has 5 rings!!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd.  Yes, Neely countered\\na minute later, but hadn\\'t this course of Buffalo going ahead after being\\ntied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities, I\\nthink Boston would have notched their first win of the series.\\n\\nWell, the Sabres haven\\'t made it to the end of this series yet, but\\nI certainly feel they\\'ve got Boston right were they want them...actually,\\nthey\\'ve got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt\\nthat would come about.  One more astronomical game by Fuhr, a few more\\nheroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and I\\nthink Borque, Neely, Jouneau (sp?), and Company are gonna be swinging\\na new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon.  I\\'m not\\ngonna waiger anything on this, because I\\'ve seen some really strange\\nthings happen in both pro and college hockey.\\n\\nTalking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseball\\nswing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev\\ndeflected in for the BIG ONE?  The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a\\ntesiment to Buffalo\\'s ability to really be persistent and grind it out\\nin the end (something they weren\\'t necessarily in the regular season).  The\\nSabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in\\nthe opening seconds.  I don\\'t normally like penalties being called in\\nsuch ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabres\\nwon a faceoff (they weren\\'t that hot in this dept the rest of the game)\\nwhen LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.

The main reason they might have stayed with Prince could be  \\njust age, especially if Spanky was creeping toward his mid-30s or something.\\n \\nAll things considered, though, I\\'d be a lot more comfortable with Spanky behind  \\nthe plate than Prince.  Isn\\'t there decent backup backstop out there looking  \\nfor work?\\n\\nSince Roger is a Canadian who probably knows nothing about baseball\\nI am gonna try to explain it to him in terms of hockey...\\n\\naccording to his logic...\\nI can say that since 1988...Bob Errey is better than Wayne Gretzky\\n\\nhey...Errey contributed to 2 Cups while good old Wayne has won nothing...\\n(I think the Kings should trade Gretzky for Errey....what do you think Roger?)\\n\\nThere is a great book out called \"They Also Served\" which is about the \\nballplayers during WWII.  There is some info on Berg in there.  It also has \\ninfo on Pete Gray (one armed outfielder) and other players of the era.  Because\\nof the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the\\ndraft for medical reasons.  There are some very interesting stories in the\\nbook. It is very well written and I would suggest reading it to anyone with an \\ninterest in baseball.\\n\\nRob Koffler\\n\\nI don\\'t buy this at all. Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that\\nwould *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool. \\nHextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ...\\nBoth Dionne\\'s and Bellows\\' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because\\nhis gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head \\nfor the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from \\nend-to-end. Kamensky\\'s mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by \\nYoung in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall \\nfor most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero \\nbecause Roy\\'s team didn\\'t make full use of their opportunities.\\n\\nHextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very \\nwell, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over \\nBellows\\' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all \\nthose opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them.\\nHextall wasn\\'t particularly brilliant on those plays ... \\n\\n\\nSure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against\\nan explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with\\na powerplay that was totally unnecessary.\\n\\n\\nI disagree. Roy played well because he wasn\\'t screened the whole night. \\nThe defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic,\\nNolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.\\n\\n\\nThis most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,\\nas did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau\\nwere *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave\\nup the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.\\n\\n\\nAnd Hextall didn\\'t on Dionne\\'s goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because\\nthat is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5,\\nwhen you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him\\nfor most of the season.\\n\\n\\nThe Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory\\ncomments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should\\nthey read the papers? They played 58 minutes of \"Burnsian\" hockey to shut\\ndown Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the \\nextra 2.\\n\\nRed Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That\\'s a guaranteed way to end the\\nseries 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ?\\nThe fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.\\n\\n\\nIf you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never\\nhave been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work\\nby Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the\\npuck up under Roy\\'s arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.\\n<In response to a debate about who has has a better season- Jagr of Francis>\\n\\nI think Jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time- stats\\ndon\\'t exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better +/-.\\n\\n\\n\\n+/- is a useful statistic.  If a player is on the ice when his team scores a\\nlot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right.\\nIt is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the\\nsame team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally\\ngood players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare\\nbetween players on different teams.\\n\\nI agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful\\nare the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is\\na missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring\\nthe quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be a\\nbetter stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice\\ntime actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given low\\namounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who\\ndoesn\\'t recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of\\nquality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that\\nthinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than\\n+/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.\\n\\n+/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent.\\nYou are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see\\nthat being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed\\nis a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such.;^)I am looking for a source of American League baseball stats for\\nindividual players in the same format as printed in newspapers, ie. I do\\nnot want to provide a list of players and get back nice printed reports\\nfor $35 a week.\\n\\nDoes anyone know of such statistics availability and an idea of the\\ncost?\\n\\nI tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues.\\nThe BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they\\nhad little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example,\\nwas rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.\\nHis subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie\\nyear.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so\\nand then rebound.\\n\\nBob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had\\ngood numbers immediately.\\n\\nI am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and\\nDerek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up\\nthat they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it\\ndidn\\'t hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching\\nwell initially, though I don\\'t have stats handy.\\nMinor point:  Shea Stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but\\nnot with the Jets in mind as the tennant.  The New York Football Giants\\nhad moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was\\nhaving problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee\\nStadium until 1972).  The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea.\\nWhen a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the\\nnew AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using\\nthe new stadium.  The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the\\nCosmos played soccer in the 70s).  Because Shea Stadium was tied into\\nthe World\\'s Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to\\npromote the new franchise and the World\\'s Fair (like they were doing\\nwith the Mets).  So the deal was worked out.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m under the impression that when Murph says it, he means it!  As a\\nregular goer to Shea, it is not a bad place since they\\'ve cleaned and\\nrenovated the place.  Remember, this is its 30th Year!\\n\\n              In the season 92/93 playing for EHC Freiburg/Germany\\n\\nBenny.NJ> : >And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been \\ntraded,  \\nNJ> : >resigned, or been striped of his title during the season?

THANKS.\\n\\n\\n\\nOkay, I think we all agree that singles hitters should take a\\nstrike or two and try to get on base any way they can.\\n\\nSo the \"No Power/Impatient\" guys have no excuse.\\nThe \"No Power/Patient\" guys are doing the right thing.\\n\\nNow the \"Impatient/Power\" guys (how could you leave out the Big Cat?).\\nWould these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took\\nmore pitches?   Perhaps, but I doubt it.  If you tell Joe Carter\\nto go up there and take a few pitches, he will draw more walks, but\\nhe also won\\'t hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because\\nhe is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive.\\n\\nThe \"Patient/Power\" guys?   Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and\\nRickey Henderson has \"a strike zone the size of Hitler\\'s heart\" \\nso they get their walks based on the small zone.\\n\\nLook at the other 5 guys: Thomas, Bonds, McGwire, Ruth and Williams.  Wow!\\nA lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe\\nwalk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them.\\nThe pitchers would do better (in my opinion) by just coming after\\nthem with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch, but pitchers\\nwould rather nibble, go 2-0 or 3-1 and then get hurt.\\nDo you really have *that* much information on him?  Really?\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know.  You tell me.  What percentage of players reach or \\nexceed their MLE\\'s *in their rookie season*?  We\\'re talking about\\n1993, you know.\\n\\n\\nIf that were your purpose, maybe.  Offerman spent 1992 getting \\nacclimated, if you will.  The Dodgers as a team paid a big price\\nthat season.  Perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road.\\nDo you really think they would have done what they did if they\\nwere competing for a pennant?\\n\\n\\nFor a stat-head, I\\'m amazed that you put any credence in spring\\ntraining.  Did you notice who he got those 10 (!) hits off of, or\\nare you going to tell me that it doesn\\'t make a difference?\\n\\n\\nWait a minute.  I missed something here.  First, forget Keith\\nMitchell.  Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA\\nand then does not improve would have been better off making a\\ndirect leap to the majors?  If a player does well at AA and then\\ndoes not improve at AAA, isn\\'t that a sign that maybe he doesn\\'t\\nbelong in the bigs?\\n\\nNow, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!)\\nhe jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was\\nreturned to the minors, where he didn\\'t do very well at all.  Now\\nhis career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your \\npoint.  Good MLE\\'s in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now\\nhe\\'s one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.\\nDuh.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I\\'ve cast my lot.  Certainly you may understand better how \\ngood Lopez is.  And I may overvalue experience.  But neither one\\nof us runs a baseball team.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\n\\nYou know... after I finished laughing I thought:  This would be a great\\nfinal.  Two Canadian teams with lots of tradition and all that Don Cherry\\nnonsense behind them and a nail-biter finish.\\n\\nOf course, I would prefer a Vancouver--Montreal final with Vancouver\\nscoring the final goal....\\n\\nPity neither will happen.Here are the final stadings for the USENET Hockey Draft.

La directrous de programme est la tete de merde!\\nAnyway, I have a satellite dish, and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming Sunday (25 Apr), and I can\\nnot find correct game times.  For the Calgary at LA game I have times showing\\neverything from 11:00 AM MDT, to 5:00 PM MDT.\\n\\nI am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming Sunday, now\\nthat ABC has mucked up the schedule.  I think I should be able to\\npull in\\nthree games (11:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 5:30 pm MDT) off the dish, but I am\\nnot sure.\\n\\nIF anybody has a schedule, pleas emial it to me.  As you can see, I have to\\ntelent to get rec.sport.hockey, and it is sometimes difficult to get a link.\\n\\nThanks in advance\\nMerci d\\'avance\\n\\nP.S.  Anglais ou francais d\\'accord.\\n\\n\\nRoland Behunin\\n\\nbehunin@oodis01.af.mil\\nbehunin@oodis01.hill.af.milActually Alomar is a two-time gold-glover (91-92).\\n\\nIt\\'s always possible, but if this is the case, I think that there is some\\nblatant discrimination going on here. Clearly Selig is allowing the opposition\\nto use pre-1920 baseballs against the Dodgers.\\n   \\n\\nAnd almost more impressive was that he also got an intentional walk.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n           We will stretch no farm animal beyond its natural length\\n\\n  paula@koufax.cv.hp.com   Paul Andresen  Hewlett-Packard  (503)-750-3511\\nThat would be Clint Malarchuck.  It was speculated at the time, that\\nthe injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end\\nof the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as the\\nambulence is parked), he never would have survived.  Ditto, if he\\nwere playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on \\nstandby.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve seen video tape of the incident, it is amazing how much blood\\nthere was.  It was literally spurting out all over the ice, as Clint\\ngrabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror.  \\n\\nAmazingly enough, he made a full recovery, and played again in the\\nNHL.  He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway,\\nand didn\\'t play for too long afterward.  Some people speculated that\\nhe just couldn\\'t get himself back together after the incident, and I\\nthink he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward.\\nHe did eventually get back to form, and played another year or so after\\nthat, and then I believe he retired.\\n\\nAnyone else?\\n\\n-- \\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCarol Boudreau            #44                         a.k.a. The X-Terminator\\nboudreau@athena.mit.edu                           Go Flames!  Rock the Kings!\\nThey did.  For $950K.So far Simmons looks like a total idiot.\\n\\n\\n1) Zane Smith should learn how to \"switchpitch\" and return from the DL. I\\nwould rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.\\n\\n2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an\\nimpressive win last week. NOw Otto\\'s latest debacle has restored Simmon\\'s\\nreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his \\'92 form when he had the\\nAL\\'s highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted\\'s sake), I hope he\\npitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.\\n\\n3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.\\nBUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have\\nshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little\\nbit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.\\nMerced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at\\nthe plate in his rookie year.\\n\\n4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that\\nWalk desrved his contract.\\n\\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\\ncan\\'t understand his and management\\'s fear of losing Tom Prince through\\nwaivers. Even if they do, what\\'s the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\\npitching). Didn\\'t Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to\\ntrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\\nwasn\\'t very fit last year.\\n\\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\\non Patterson in stead.\\n\\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn\\'t been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\\n\\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn\\'t given a contract extension last year? NOw his\\nvalue has increased immensely.\\n\\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\\nLet\\'s see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won\\'t be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\\n\\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon\\'s tenure was\\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\\n\\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\\nnothing else will.\\n\\nOn a final note. Tim Wakefield won\\'t be as awful as he was in his last 2\\nstarts. BUt don\\'t count on him pitching like last year for the rest of\\nthe season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the\\nseason, they will miss Redus\\'s clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked\\nin the second half of the last 2 seasons)>\\n\\n\\nTake a look at the standings. It\\'s REAL easy to get so focussed on \\nminutinae and forget that the Giants happen to be in first place. If it\\'s\\nworking, you don\\'t SCREW IT UP by changing things, just because you think it\\nought to be different.\\n\\nSome folks like to argue about theoretical details. I prefer to watch teams\\nwin. When the Giants slip to third, then we can talk about how to re-arrange\\nthe batting order. Until then, I think it\\'s stupid to focus on what\\'s wrong,\\nfor the simple fact that IT\\'S WORKING AS IT IS.\\n\\n\\nIn the majors? I don\\'t follow AL, so I won\\'t comment on \"Majors\". In the NL,\\nif I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team, it\\'d be Clark, and\\nI\\'d hit him third. (My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it, because\\nI\\'ve never been able to GET Clark. I\\'d take any of the three without\\nhesitation in real life, but I think Clark is it).\\n\\nWilliams: Not even close. I much prefer his defense, but when he isn\\'t\\nheadcasing it, Matt has a good, solid swing and some real punch. If he drops\\nto .230, then he wanders out of cleanup, but according to the latest\\nBaseball Weekly, he\\'s hitting .275, and in the last week, hitting .296.\\nThat\\'s not exactly chopped liver.\\n\\nMostly, though, the Giants are winning, and frankly, as long as that\\ncontinues, it\\'s rather silly to second-guess their strategy. But evidently,\\nsome folks would rather be right than be first.\\n\\nWhile I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory, I think it must\\nbe realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis   \\nJoseph.  When a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do.\\nJoseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis, because otherwise there \\nwould probably be a game 6 scheduled.  \\n\\nAs for the game on Sunday.  The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt.\\nOne was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons to\\ngive them penalties.  Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puck\\nhit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman, no shot\\nfor Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis\\'\\ngoals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone\\nwho didn\\'t belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player.\\nFinally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease.  No goalie, no way to stop the shot.\\n\\nI congratulate St. Louis for beating the Hawks.  It will be a shame to see\\nBryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph\\nwon\\'t be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack.\\n\\n\\n____________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to \"Quotations from Chairman Cherry\", Don was playing in\\nSpringfield. He and another player had to pay some fines; the other\\nplayer had his paid off, but not Don didn\\'t want to.\\n\\nDon called the other player a \"teacher\\'s Pet\", and the other player\\nreplied \"Ah, that\\'s just sour grapes\".Of all teams, I believe the Cubs have the best record ever in baseball.\\nSometime way far back. 110+ and something.You might want to clarify the 11 game winning streak.  That Pens streak\\nis a PLAYOFF streak (tied by the Chicago Blackhawks, who had won 11 in a row\\nuntil they met the Pens in the finals last year)  The 18 game unbeaten, so far,\\nis a regular season unbeaten streak.  But hey, don\\'t take it personally.  I\\'m a\\nFlyers fan and two in a row is a stretch.  But with a healthy Lindros, Recchi,\\nBrind\\'amour and Tommy Soderstrom, they\\'ll be there next year!\\nBy the way, since the Flyers need defenseman, what kind of trade would\\nanybody suggest from the existing Flyers roster since the scuttlebutt is that\\n\\nTerry Carkner won\\'t be there next year and apart from him a piece of notebook\\npaper would be better defense.I\\'ve a curiousity --\\n\\n  Whenever a person is put on the 15-day, 30-day or 60-day, \\n the person is on the list longer than the specificed time\\n\\n  I\\'ve seen a person on the 15-day for maybe 4 months last year, I don\\'t\\n remember what...\\n\\n I just need a little clarification on the disabled list specifications.\\n\\n- Scotyy\\n\\nNot bad. We had a similar situation. Slowpitch softball, bases loaded,\\nweakest hitter at the plate. He hits a line drive over the third\\nbaseman\\'s head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in\\nfoul ground, almost hitting the fence down that side of the field.\\nBut the umpire called fair ball! I was coaching third, yelling at evrybody \\nto move up a base. The ump\\'s position: \"it was still fair when it\\npassed third base\". \\nWhy the other team didn\\'t immediately protest I\\'ll never know; we\\ncertainly weren\\'t going to argue about it, since every body did manage\\nto advance one base safely.\\n\\nThere was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my (runner\\nfrom second base) leg, fielded by the SS, steps on second to force the\\nrunner from first, and throw to first in time for what the umpire\\ncalled a triple play; protest removed when we won the game anyway.Here are the NHL\\'s alltime leaders in goals and points at the end of\\nthe 1992-3 season. Again, much thanks to Joseph Achkar.\\n\\nCarl\\n\\nNotes: An active player is a player that has scored at least one\\npoint the past season.

When I saw the incident on\\nBaseball Tonight Sunday, I couldn\\'t believe how far away from the plate\\nGant went.  Then he casually leaned against his bat.  I don\\'t blame the \\numpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch.\\n\\n  The worst part of the whole incident was the Braves coming out onto the\\nfield.  What were they going to do, attack the umpire?  The only people\\nwho should\\'ve been out there were Cox and maybe the coaches, but NO players.\\nI agree with the person who posted before that Cox should be suspended for\\nhaving no control over his team.\\n\\nIt is a long standing good luck Redwing\\'s tradition to throw an octopus \\non the ice during a Stanley Cup game. They say it dates back to \\'52\\nat the Olympia when the Wings became the 1st team (I think) to sweep \\nthe cup in 8 games. A lot hardet to throw one from Joe Louis seats\\nthan from the old Olympia balcony, though.Just a side note, squid/octopi made their way to the ice in Buffalo.\\nI still don\\'t understand why Buffalo, but maybe it\\'s lucky.  :-)  btw,\\nthey shovel them up from the ice here, using the shovel used to scoop\\nup the snow the zamboni leaves as it leaves the ice.  Although Blue\\ndid give some technical directions on its removal, motioning with his\\nstick.  \\n\\n\\n-=> Quoting Cire Y.

I was more\\nthan a little worried about Viola\\'s elbow.\\n\\nBut you *surely* remember my shout of relief when, after a week of\\nrumors that Morris was coming to the Red Sox, they ended up with Viola\\ninstead.\\n\\nNow I\\'m even happier.  Viola seems to have rebounded nicely.\\n\\n\\nHow long did Viola sign for.  Three years?  I generally agree with\\ntheir policy of avoiding long-term contracts for pitchers.  But I\\nthink they enforce it rather too strictly.  These days the premier\\npitchers all sign three or four year deals.  Which leaves the Jays\\nwith Morris and Stewart.  If the Jays want to compete for top free\\nagent pitchers, they will have to accept greater risks.\\n\\nAny idea what the option year deal is for Morris?  Are there any\\nautomatic activation clauses?  What is the buyout amount?fJust out of curiosity, what happened to the weekly AL and NL Game\\nScore Reports?  I used to enjoy reading them throughout the summer\\nfor the last two years.\\n\\nInquisitively yours,\\n\\nJoel\\nA-hem. Two words: Russell Davis. Playing in the cavern at Albany (AA) last\\nyear (375/410/385 down the alleys and to center), Davis went .285/.355/.483\\nwith 22 homers. There aren\\'t any small parks on the road in the Eastern\\nLeague, either. He\\'s 23(!) and his MLE was .258/.308/.416, 17 HR. I have no\\nfielding statistics, but from seeing him a number of times last year I\\'d say\\nthat he\\'s not Brooks Robinson, but neither is he Howard Johnson. Unless they\\nthink they can win the pennant *this year* (which seems possible) and need\\nBoggs to do it, I think they\\'re making the same sort of mistake with Davis\\nthat Boston made with Boggs, leaving him in the minors for two or three\\nyears after he\\'d shown that he was a good hitter.\\n\\n\\nHrm? They still have him on the roster (16 AB through the first two weeks).\\nThey\\'ve just never figured out what to do with him. I suspect that he hits\\nenough (especially vs. lefties) to be a reasonable shortstop. One rumor\\nrunning around during spring training was that they wanted to convert\\nSilvestri to be a catcher(!) because \"his body type was wrong for a\\nshortstop\".  You\\'d think that somebody in the same *division*, who plays\\nBaltimore about a dozen times a year, would know better.\\n\\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.comRoger Maynard shares his views, with the masses, on Bob Gainey\\nand life in general:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIt was Bryan Trottier, not Denis Potvin.  It was a vicious\\n\\'boarding\\' from behind...Trottier was given a major.\\n \\nBut Roger, what the hell does this have to do with Gainey\\'s skill\\nas a hockey player?  If Probert smashes Gilmour\\'s head into the\\nboards next week, will that diminish your assessment of Gilmour\\'s\\nskills?\\n \\n \\nI would take Fuhr and Sanderson off of the latter.\\n \\nI think Gainey would be honoured to know that you\\'ve included him\\non this list.  I also think you have a relatively naive view\\nabout what wins a hockey game...pluggers are an integral part of\\nany team.  The Selke is designed to acknowledge their\\ncontribution...I think that most people understand that it\\'s not\\nthe Nobel Prize...so settle down.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\ncongenially, as always,\\n \\njd\\n \\n--\\nJames David\\ndavid@student.business.uwo.ca\\nOn the other hand, I\\'m hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes\\nFereirra made.  Imagine indeed, but then again we have the benefit of\\nhindsight.\\n\\nLet\\'s say that in the view of the Sharks\\' upper management, the attempt\\nto trade Kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire Feirerra.\\nI\\'m inclined to take exactly the opposite view:  they should have kept\\nhim...he\\'s obviously the luckiest man in hockey!

(His job, I guess.))\\n\\nhave fun\\ngak\\nI need the box score from the April 15 game I believe the score was 5 to 4\\nif anyone can provide  it for me I would appreciate it....It is my understanding that the Dead will sing the NA at the Giants\\nhome opener on Mon. 4/12. The Giants are opening today in St. Louis.\\n\\nluigi\\nCould be. There is a Jayson Stark that writes weekly for some press syndicate \\nand also for Baseball America.\\n\\n\\nStark has done this sort of thing, but he has never been serious about it.\\nHe usually states that this sort of projection is useless at the top of \\nsuch columns. I think he did it one season and some manager was \"projected\" \\nto be thrown out of 60 games and some hitter could expect to be plunked \\n150 times.\\n\\nStark does some really funny stuff. His weekly baseball reviews are good \\ncollections of strange things that happened during the previous week. He \\nalso regularly prints Kinerisms.\\nOkay, I\\'ll bite.  How can OBP be *lower* than batting average?\\nSac flies or something?NHL RESULTS FOR GAMES PLAYED 4/15/93.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                  STANDINGS\\n      PATRICK              ADAMS              NORRIS              SMYTHE\\n TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT\\n \\nxPIT  56 21  7 119  xBOS  51 26  7 109  xCHI  47 25 12 106  xVAN  46 29  9 101\\nyWAS  42 34  7  91  yQUE  47 27 10 104  yDET  47 28  9 103  yCAL  43 30 11  97\\nyNJ   40 36  7  87  yMON  48 30  6 102  yTOR  44 29 11  99  yLA   39 35 10  88\\nyNYI  39 37  7  85  yBUF  38 36 10  86  ySTL  37 36 11  85  yWIN  40 37  7  87\\n PHL  35 37 11  81   HAR  26 51  6  58   MIN  36 38 10  82   EDM  26 50  8  60\\n NYR  34 38 11  79   OTT  10 70  4  24   TB   23 54  7  53   SJ   11 71  2  24\\n\\nx -

Then again, there are lots of foreign-born players on the Canadian\\nnational soccer team so the Brits give something back to you in the end:-)\\n---\\nFor the record, former NY Rangers coach Ted \"Darth\" Sator recently led\\nLion Milan (Jari Kurri\\'s former team, only the nickname\\'s changed\\n[Devils->Lion]) to their second straight Italian championship.

NHL teams can\\'t afford to\\nimport role players from Europe, they pick the stars but will continue to build\\ntheir teams around local players.\\n\\nI\\'d *LOVE* to see a European NHL division but can\\'t see it happen for some\\ntime. There\\'s simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several\\n\"crucial\" markets like Germany, Italy and France while Sweden and Finland\\nprobably can\\'t afford to shell out $20-$30 for tickets the way\\nAmerican/Canadian fans do.

There may have been a few changes\\nfor the actual game (guys not being able to participate or whatever).\\n\\n\\n\\nI AM an Ulf (and Pgh) fan, and what pisses me off about the whole Adam Graves/\\nUlf Samuesson debate is that Ulf plays hard-hitting hockey (nothing wrong with \\nthat) while Graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to \\nintentionally hurt someone (which bites!).\\n\\n\\nI thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this season to stop crap \\nlike that?!?  Is it just me, or does the officiating just still stink to high\\nheaven?  IMHO, if they could get rid of the existing refs, and institute a new\\nsystem with more than one ref on the ice to keep an eye on the trouble-makers\\nthen a lot of these things would stop, and then the game would be ruled by the\\nfinnesse players:  Mario, Selanne, Bure, Messier, et.al...\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s Stankiewicz, not Stankowitz, and he\\'s not Jewish - he\\'s Polish\\n(by the way, the correct pronunciation - according to Stanky himself,\\nis \"ston-KEV-itch\". all the sportscasters get it wrong)\\n\\n\\nThe only other Jewish ballplayer I can think of is Ron Blomberg, who is\\nbest known as being the first DH to appear in a major league ballgame.\\n     The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux\\ndid not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night.  He threw 2 straight\\nfastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the\\nfirst one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd,\\nwhen Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally\\nwalk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.\\n\\n     The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has\\nnot scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I\\'m concerning\\nabout his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he\\nhas to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.\\n\\n\\n\\n     The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba\\nhas done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher\\nfrom last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With\\nBurba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed\\nreliever aside from Rod Beck, he\\'ll get a lot of actions.  I also hope that\\nDusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig, especially on Beck.\\nI was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.\\n\\n\\n\\n     So far so good!\\n\\n                          ^^\\n      \\n\\n\\nFunny you should mention it...this is exactly the case I was going to make.\\n\\n\\nI will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks. \\nBut this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase \\nwill last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking\\none.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support\\nthem.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you\\'d have knee surgery\\nfor some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  \\n\\n\\nOk.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. \\n\\n\\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\\nit wasn\\'t Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I\\'m nit-picking and mincing words, go back\\nand read from where this thread started...\\n\\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan\\'s mind who suddenly\\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\\namazing, I\\'ll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we\\'ve got a *kick*\\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I\\'ll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don\\'t go to\\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\\nholders in LA don\\'t always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\\ninitial success following Gretzky\\'s arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \\n\\nWhether or not the Kings are a \\'winner\\' is debatable.  I claim that since\\nGretzky\\'s arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\\ndynasty...but that\\'s another story and included only because I don\\'t like\\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\\n\\n\\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it\\'s inevitable that the team\\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\\nmake people around them better.\\n\\n\\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\\n\\n\\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn\\'t resist...>\\n\\n\\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It\\'s difficult to predict, but do you think\\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\\nwill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that\\ncase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without\\nSelanne.In Detroit, the octopus is a symbol from the old days of the league. In\\nthe era of the Original 6, four teams made the playoffs.  To win the Cup,\\na team had to win two seven-game series - in other words it took 8\\nplayoff wins to win the Cup.  The octopus (8 legs) has become a common\\nDetroit symbol.

Eight games into the season, they\\nalready have two wins each from Clemens and Viola.  Clemens starts\\nagain tonight, on three days rest.\\n\\nWhat\\'s up?  Are the Sox going with a four-man rotation?  Is this why\\nHesketh was used in relief last night?\\n\\nHm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSheesh.  The rumor mill strikes again.  But let\\'s just assume this were true.\\nMy question is this:\\n\\nWhat would Montreal give San Jose if the Sharks got first pick and took Daigle?\\n\\n  That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPN\\'s piece about\\nprospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of\\nFame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked \\nat players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they\\nwere 24, and noticed some interesting things. \\n\\n  For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in\\nthe history of the game. They also found out such players represented the\\nmajority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that\\nthey actually did some number-crunching and found that such players\\' careers\\nlasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  \\nfound that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and\\nproduced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first\\ngroup outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away\\nthe second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc. \\n\\n  It was the most impressive thing I\\'ve seen on ESPN in recent memory. \\n\\n  I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight. \\n \\n  An interesting note ... I have absolutely no recollection who was on my team.\\n  I picked all my players about 2 weeks before the start of the season, and\\n  then never touched the roster again.  I got wrapped up in my own \"money\" pool\\n  and decided not to get involved at all with the USENET pool (sorry Andrew\\n  btw).  The only thing I remember about my team is that I had Joe Sacco and\\n  maybe John MacLean.  Maybe Francis and Kevin Stevens as well.  Out of\\n  curiousity I checked the final standings today on r.s.h., only to find to my\\n  amazement that with absolutely no input, the initial team still managed to\\n  finsh 79th!  I\\'m not sure what that implies for those who finished below me\\n  :)\\n\\n  Ciao.\\n  Brad Gibson\\n\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  Brad K.

His speed, skating ability, and puck control is\\n: exceptional -- he is the one to watch on the Kings.\\n: \\n\\nI agree, with Marty McSorely and Warren Rychel running a close second and \\nthird. I am surprised more people have not noted Knickle as the biggest\\nsurprise, even though I personally do not really rate him well. The biggest \\ndisappointment has to be Carson. Though this is really unfair, since too much \\nwas expected of him. The second biggest disappointment is Melrose, with his \\nadolescent handling of the goaltending problems. Putting Hrudey on the bench \\nfor a month is just stupid. It did not contribute to the team coming out of \\nits slump. MVP is surely Robitaille.The problem with your nihilistic approach, Roger, is that it takes all the\\nsense out of the game.  By your line of reasoning, if a guy hits into a\\ndouble play with one out and the bases loaded, there\\'s no point in saying\\nthat that was a bad thing to do (if his team won anyway) or speculating\\non what might have happened if things had gone otherwise, so the double\\nplay is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was\\neventually won or lost for unknown reasons.  After all, any speculation\\ninvolves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn\\'t.\\n\\nRoger, do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the\\nceiling instead?  Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence?\\n\\nTeams go to the post-season when they win more games than anybody else\\nin their division.  If they don\\'t make the post-season, they don\\'t win the\\nSeries.  Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate\\ngoal in ring-collecting?\\n\\nIf so, you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal\\ntowards winning the division, and our disagreements come when we consider\\nhow to win games.\\n\\nIn your viewpoint as expressed, winning games happens for reasons that\\ncannot be analyzed.  While many of us are thinking things like \"Base-\\nrunners are good, outs are bad, and therefore walks are better than\\ndouble plays with the bases loaded\", you are thinking things like\\n\"It\\'s a team game, so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious\\nteam dynamics that will cause the team to win today\".\\n\\nThe result is that it becomes impossible to say *anything* about individual\\nplayers.  Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing left\\nfield.  After all, perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would\\nhave helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt\\nit.  Therefore, I could be an extremely valuable player.  Did Dave Winfield\\nhave anything to do with the Jays\\' victory?  Probably, but how do you know?\\nIf you replace him with Andres Galarraga, perhaps the Jays would have won,\\nperhaps they would have lost, perhaps they would have defected to Alpha\\nCentauri (bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed\\nin mid-season had Winfield been DHing for Toronto).\\n\\nWas Babe Ruth a good player?  He played on some WS-winning teams, but did\\nhe have anything to do with their success?\\n\\nIt is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player, and\\nJarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder weren\\'t.  It seems to me that anybody who\\nwould deny this needs to provide the proof.\\n\\nNow, we have observed things about baseball over the years, both empirically\\nand by looking at the rulebook.  It is necessary to score more runs than\\none\\'s opponent to win the game, so it would seem important to score runs\\nand to prevent one\\'s opponent from scoring.  Runs are scored while a team\\nis batting, and an inning ends after the third out, so it would seem that\\nmaking outs is bad while hitting home runs is good.  Players have tendencies\\nto hit or pitch at certain levels, and these are usually somewhat consistent\\nfrom year to year.\\n\\nWe do use these statistics to predict winners, and so do you.  To make\\nsome flat predictions:  Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP+SLG than\\nGene Larkin this year.  The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies\\nin the standings.  The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals, but\\nwill also give up more.  I would be astonished if any of these turned\\nout to be false, and, I suspect, so would you.  As a matter of fact, I\\nam pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year, given\\n3-4 guesses per division, and this is certainly better than random\\nchance (and almost statistically significant).\\n\\nIf you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet in\\nthe World Series, you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure\\nlikelihoods, however fuzzy.\\nSo how about \"real life\"?  Person A robs a service station with two people\\nin it, using a .38 automatic pistol, gets $42, and is convicted and sentenced\\nfor three years.  Person B, with a similar criminal record, robs a service\\nstation with two people in it, using a .38 revolver, gets $42, and is\\nconvicted.  Since they used two different types of handgun, are comparisons\\ntotally meaningless?\\n\\nSay you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works (my cats are always\\ntesting this - they don\\'t trust me to pay the gravity bill on time).  You\\nhave never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before, so\\nall previous evidence is meaningless?  Or would you be surprised if it flew\\nout the window instead of hitting the desk?Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate,\\nwith Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times.\\nMy opinion, FWIW, to all:\\n\\nMark, age doesn\\'t matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried\\nrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven\\nhimself to be average at best. I don\\'t care if he is 15; if he plays\\nbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent\\nminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las\\nVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major\\nleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I\\'ll admit). Santiago\\'s\\nnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy\\'s, but I don\\'t have\\nthe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.\\n\\nThat being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to\\nstart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league\\nseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very\\npoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill\\nare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,\\nthey are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around\\n.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on\\nthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was\\njust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at\\nany level, at any age, doesn\\'t satisfy MY standards of evidence.\\n\\n    JAVIER LOPEZ 1971         \\n  1990 BUR    428  101  10   1   9    5    0   1  .179   33  .236  .245  .327\\n  1991 DUR    389   84   8   1   9   14    7   2  .175   29  .216  .243  .311\\n  1992 GRN    445  135  22   2  14   22    7   2  .271   71  .303  .336  .456\\n  1992 ATL     16    6   2   0   0    0    0   0  .306    3  .375  .375  .500\\n    MAJ        16    6   2   0   0    0    0   0  .306    3  .375  .375  .500\\n    MIN      1262  320  40   4  32   41   14   5  .213  133  .254  .277  .368\\n    TOT      1278  326  42   4  32   41   14   5  .214  136  .255  .278  .369\\n    MAJ       650  244  81   0   0    0    0   0\\n    MIN       630  160  20   2  16   20    7   2\\n    TOT       630  161  21   2  16   20    7   2\\n\\nOn a similar note, I don\\'t understand why more people are not\\nsupportive of Neon Deion.

The\\nargument was\\n\\n1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game.\\n2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.\\n\\n3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and\\nearned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12%\\nof defense and pitching is 88% of defense.\\n4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.\\n\\nPete is usually sharper than that.

What gives?\\n(is there some custom to throw octopuses on the ice in Detroit?)\\n-------\\nNot Responsible -- Dain Bramaged!!\\n  The same Bill James? Why do you say that? It sounds like you\\'re suggesting \\nBill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire;\\nhe was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn\\'t\\nall-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when\\neveryone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy\\nCampanella. \\n\\n\\n  Which reports are those? \\n\\n\\n  I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you\\'ve gotta play\\nhim IMHO. He\\'s a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn\\'t a *bad* hitter.\\nRight now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez\\nwill be Candiotti\\'s caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they\\nplay up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching\\ntandem.  \\n\\n\\n  I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols\\' Law of catcher\\ndefense), but that\\'s something that\\'s difficult to prove or disprove from\\nyour viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is\\nopponent\\'s SB%, and that\\'s clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.\\nCatchers ERA is a possibility, but it\\'s subject to way too many biases. \\n\\n  As for them \\'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big\\nbat\\', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves\\' armor is that\\nthey\\'re weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard\\nplays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak \\ndefensively if Blauser plays. I\\'d like to see the Braves give at least one of\\nMel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich\\nJays of recent years they\\'ll be conservative and stick with what they have. \\nI\\'m not saying that\\'s wrong, just conservative. \\n \\n\\nHey!  What\\'s this?  We agree!\\n\\nNo platoon advantage (Sabo vs. Samuel).\\n\\nBoth players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters,\\n\\tand both have a reputation of being fooled too often with\\n\\tslow curves and change ups.\\n\\nSabo has more power, and a little bit of a better batting eye.  Samuel\\n\\tis noted as an agressive free-swinger.  Sabo has more homerun power.\\n\\nBoth players started the game hitting below .200.  \\n\\nThere may have been some game considerations that might have prompted\\n\\tPerez to want to reserve Samuel for use later.  But the game\\n\\t*was* on the line, and Samuel never did get in.\\n\\nGiven all of this, I don\\'t see a lot to suggest pinch-hitting, nor do\\nI see anything to suggest no pinch-hitting.

Specifically Im looking for Red Sox stats so\\nfar, Id like all of them, but could handle just Greenwell and Vaughn.  CAN\\nANYBODY PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!\\nGenerally I agree with you. However, (1) last night ESPN cut away to Baseball\\nTonite, which looks like SportsCenter tailored to baseball, and they cut\\naway at 7:40 pacific. That\\'s quite a contract they have there. (2) if\\nESPN couldn\\'t deliver, they should have had a transistion plan to\\nlet SportsChannel pick up the slack.\\n\\nNonetheless, it is ultimately the fault of the US-American public that regular\\nseason baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the U.S.\\nSupport your team; support your game.\\n\\nSomebody in r.s.h. had an excellent idea that we should write Chrysler\\nto thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would\\nconsider their products.

Al\\nMorgani (or however you spell the idiot\\'s name) must be from Chicago,\\nbecause on ESPN, he said \"it\\'s not even close--Chicago will definatly win\\nthe Norris Division in the Playoffs, no other team is close.\"  Everyone is\\npicking Chicago!  I don\\'t get it, he says it\\'s an \"easy choice\"?\\nGod, Chicago was 1-4-1 against the Wings, and they won the division by a\\npoint or two, followed closely by Toronto, who is also a good team!\\nAs for the Leafs beating Detroit--doubt it, but even if they do, they\\naren\\'t going to get by Chicago.  If (even more amazingly) they get past the\\nHawks, they would probably face Vancouver, and lose.\\nAs for The Habs reaching the Finals, forget it.  Even I, as a devoted Wings\\nfan, will watch the Penguins easily three-peat as Cup winners.  Lemieux,\\nJagr, Tocchet, Stevens, and Barrasso, its a done deal.  Sorry Detroit, wait\\ntil next year.\\nBut hey, these were Paul\\'s picks, and everyone has a right to their own\\nopinnions, but the Leafs to the Finals??? Yeah. If they make it there, I\\'ll\\nwalk to Toronto to get some tickets, and that\\'s a 700 mile walk!  \\n\\n--Ryan--\\nAnd won\\'t they have to change their name to the \"Steelers\" or something.\\nThe only significant deposits of oil around Hamilton are those caused by\\nthe tire fire a  few years back.\\nSorry, Sherri, but I can\\'t agree with this particular incident.  While\\nI\\'m all for cutting down the number of chain-rattles and other examples\\nof rampant Hargroving, there was a difference here.\\n\\n1)  Since time immemorial, batters have complained about calls.\\nSo have pitchers and catchers.  Usually, nothing happens.\\nUnless the league notified teams this year about not allowing\\ncomplaints, Hirschbeck was acting against expectations.\\n\\n2)  It\\'s not as if Gant was \"in Hirschbeck\\'s face\".  Gant said\\nsomething about the call, stepped out of the box, and turned away\\nfrom Hirschbeck.  As a hitter (alibet of little consequence, but\\nwith a decent eye), whenever receiving the short end of the stick\\non a questionable call, I\\'d want a moment or two out of the box,\\nif for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on\\nthe experience of the last pitch.  And if I was really angry\\nat the ump, I\\'d rather turn away and catch my breath than\\nturn to him and say something that might get me tossed,\\nespecially at a key moment in the game.\\n\\nWhen Gant turned away, Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant\\nto step into the box.  IMO, at this point in time, Hirschbeck\\nwas determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game.\\nGant wasn\\'t dawdling; he hadn\\'t had a chance to dawdle.  And Hirschbeck\\nwas simply exercising a power play.  Gant resisted, as many of\\nus might to what we thought was an unreasonable request, and\\nHirschbeck called for the pitch.  At that point, Cox came out on\\nthe field, the pitch was thrown, and many other Braves left the\\ndugout.  Cox was tossed \"protecting his player\".  I was pleasantly\\nsurprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game.\\n\\nIt\\'s a small sample size, but based on what I saw in that game,\\nMark Hirschbeck has a hair-trigger temper and a need to play\\nGod on the field.  Not good qualities for an umpire.  I will\\nkeep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the \\nfuture, in order to improve my sample size.\\n\\nIMO, any game where you remember the name of the umpire was\\na bad game for the umpire.\\n\\tJohn Smoltz, Tom Glavine, German Jiminez, Dale Murphy, Bruce Sutter,\\nPete Smith, Rick Mahler, Jim Acker, Jim \"Break on Through\" Morrison, Ron\\nGant, Andres Thomas, Gerald Perry, Ozzie \"The Aeneid\" Virgil, Lonnie Smith,\\nJerry Royster.\\n\\tHow\\'m I doing so far?\\n\\tNOTE:  I am not a Braves fun.n\\n\\n On the other hand, ask any\\n\\n\\tOn the other hand , II like the Braves *much* more than the\\nCubs.

Although I still do not think the move will draw fans to the\\ngame; IMO it\\'s a cosmetic change that Bettman and the owners _hope_ \\nwill have an effect.  And it doesn\\'t say much for the mentality of \\nanybody it works on, either.  \\n\\n\\nSurprise, I agree totally.  The points system is fine, if everybody at all\\ntimes has played the same number of games.  Since this is almost never the\\ncase, winning percentage is the way to go.  I don\\'t particularly care if it \\nis an \"American\" thing either, if it works.  \\n\\n\\nThem thar\\'s fighting words...hardly a force...geez...miss the playoffs\\nonce in 15 years, and even after making the final four 3 times in the\\nlast five years, and everyone thinks its doomsville.\\n\\n\\nFedorov, Primeau, Kozlov, Lidstrom, Sillinger, Konstantinov, Drake,\\nKennedy, Racine, and Cheveldae were already in the pipeline due to\\nDevellano...Murray inherited these guys...in addition to Yzerman,\\nProbert, Carson, Chiasson, etc.\\n\\n\\nNo...Quinn had far less...Murray took over Detroit at a time to \\ntake advantage of all of Devellano\\'s good drafting...if Devellano\\nhad not given in to Demers request to make the Oates trade, he might\\nstill be GM.\\nIt would help if his OBP were higher than his batting average. Yes, the\\nApril 12 USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a .422 batting average\\nand a .413 OBP. That\\'s on 19-for-45 hitting with 0 (zip, nil, nada) walks.\\nThe reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that he\\'s has a long history\\nof showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability (except for\\ndrawing walks). If he hit .400 for, say, even 250 AB\\'s I\\'d be convinced that\\nthere was a real change in his ability. If he did it with an OBP<AVG, I\\'d\\nnot only be amazed but I\\'d make a bet that that would be a unique feat in\\nthe history of the game. But what do 45 AB\\'s prove? Look at some of the\\nother fluke players at this point in the season:\\n  Player    AVG AB\\n  Blauser  .367 49\\n  Grace    .391 48\\n  Milligan .400 35\\n  Conine   .375 40\\n  Lansing  .400 50\\n  Slaught  .406 32\\nAre any of these guys really that good? Well, in a word, no. How significant\\nis Galarraga\\'s average? At the 45 AB level, a hit is worth about .020. If\\nhe\\'d had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good\\ndefensive play, he\\'d be in the .380 range. If he goes 0-for-4 in his next\\ngame he\\'s all the way down to .388. In one game. Come back in June. Let\\'s\\ntalk then.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s history, Greg. Andres\\' history is that he doesn\\'t walk much because he\\nswings at bad pitches, so his average isn\\'t very good. 45 AB\\'s doesn\\'t mean\\nan awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand, especially when\\nthere\\'s ample evidence (0 BB in 1992) that his basic hitting approach hasn\\'t\\nchanged. Yeah, he might suddenly have turned into a .400 hitter who never\\nwalks, but don\\'t bet the rent money on it.\\n\\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\\n\\nYou wouldn\\'t have to put my name at the bottom if you simply appended a \\nstandard disclaimer that the opinions expressed in your petition in no\\nway claim to represent the views of either rec.sport.hockey or the internet\\nas a whole.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\\n \\n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50\\'s was made up of people who lived in \\nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \\nMontreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.\\n \\n Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?\\n A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to \\nsignify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer \\nexisted and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.\\n\\n Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?\\n A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is \\na weekly journal with up-to-date info.\\nPhone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)\\nPhone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)\\n \\n Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in \\nthe NHL?\\n A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 \\nchances.\\n \\n Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?\\n A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when \\na goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a \\n+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-\\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\\n \\n Q: What is the five-hole?\\n A: The space between a goalie\\'s pads. There are five major scoring zones: \\n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \\nright, and (5) five-hole.\\n \\n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950\\'s when two best-of-seven \\nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \\ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\\n\\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \\nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \\nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \\nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \\nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \\nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \\nlost the game, 6-4.\\n\\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \\nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \\nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \\nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\\n\\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \\nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \\nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992.

A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell \\nUniversity in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.\\n\\n Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?\\n A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and \\nColonial Hockey Leagues.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\n9.

WFAN is second to none.  Jody Mac\\'s exit was quite a\\nloss, but if you think Fredericks On The FAN was much of one, you\\'re pretty\\nskewed.\\nAs the heading indicates, it is impossible for me to fathom why Barry is not\\nbatting 4th for the Giants behind Will Clark.  Barry is such an awesome and\\nconsistent hitter -- definitely the best in the National League.  IMHO, to \\nhave Williams, a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting\\n4th ahead of Bonds is simply an injustice to the Giants and fans of the\\nGiants.\\n\\nWasn\\'t there an 85,000 New York at Cleveland game in the late 40\\'s?\\tFinns had to do their best last night when they played against Norway\\nin world champs. After two periods the score was still 0-0. This game was \\nquite much similar to the first game Finland played  (against France).\\nThe norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. In the third period\\nJuha Riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound, the time was around 5 mins or so.\\nThe second goal was scored by Kari Harila, who shot straight from a faceoff\\nbehind the Nowwegian goalie. Saku Koivu, the 18-year-old center got his first\\npoint of this tournament. Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and he\\nwas awarded the best player of the game- prize. Despite the fact that he is\\nquite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater. \\nI think that we will hear from this guy in the future.\\n\\n\\nBut,\\n THEY FACED THE PHILLIES -- A TEAM THAT GOT OFF TO AN 8-1 START.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  To be honest, I think the city of Houston loves the new owner.  He has\\nbrought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players that\\nwere from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros.  I don\\'t\\nthink that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team\\nas he has already admitted that he doesn\\'t know a whole lot about baseball.\\nMcLane is a businessman, and doesn\\'t like excuses.  He makes a valid point\\nthat injuries shouldn\\'t be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the\\nbench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid\\noutfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The\\npitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  We\\'re dealing with a young\\nHouston team, so injuries shouldn\\'t play a big role.  The only threat is\\nthe bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with the\\ntype of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen.the owners are whining about baseball not being popular among a\\nlarge enough portion of the population, and have suggested various\\n\"remedies\", such as shortening the game or trying to convince us that\\n\"smoke\\'embake\\'emdominatebysheerintimidation\" is an accurate description\\nof what is, essentially, a laid-back game.\\n\\nforget those lame ideas.  here is my new and exciting two-point plan to\\ngenerate interest in baseball among the masses.\\n\\npoint one: sex.\\npoint two: violence.\\n\\nlet\\'s face it, sex and violence are the only things that sell in\\namerica.  here\\'s how we can implement them in the game:\\n\\nsex: cheerleaders, cheerleaders, and more cheerleaders.  dancing on top\\n     of the dugouts.  bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh\\n     inning stretch.  running up and down the stands.  (the south bend\\n     white sox actually do this).\\n\\nviolence: baseball players are such utter wuss boys.  the pitcher beans\\n     the batter, and both benches empty in what is called a \"bench-clearing\\n     brawl\".  EVERYBODY JUST STANDS THERE AND LOOKS AT EACH OTHER. stand,\\n     stand, stand.  look, look, look.  ho, hum.  then, the bullpens\\n     come running in.  when they reach the \"fight\", they just stand\\n     there, too.\\n\\n     anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch\\n     should be suspended and fined.  further, the bullpens should fight\\n     it out in the outfield, so as not to waste time and energy running\\n     to the infield.\\n\\nfootball: sex, violence.\\nbasketball: sex, violence.\\nhockey: violence.\\nbaseball: \"da pastime of da nayshun!\" - yawn.   --Minnesota definitely deserves an NHL franchise!!!  You\\'ll see the\\nMinnesota Whalers pretty soon, so fear not Minnesota fans.  No Norm Green,\\n\\'cept for the team color (sorry, bad pun!)\\n\\n   --What a difference two years makes!  Minnesota finished 29-37-14 in 1992\\nand made the finals.  They finish with a better record at  38-38-10 thi year\\nand move to Dallas.  Every team in the playoffs has a winning record!!!\\nFinally!!!  It\\'s about time, NHL!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExactly my point.  If you\\'d watch games more closely, you\\'d see a lot \\nof goons going after him.  Ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical \\nplayers for Pgh are left alone.  Ulf plays rough hockey, but only when \\nother players are putting the rush on Mario or Jagr.  If you want to say anyone\\non the Penguins is a cheap shot or a goon, say it\\'s Jennings or Caufield.  Don\\'tslander a good defenseman because your favorite players can\\'t beat the Pens\\neven when they take dives (like Gartner) to try for the cheap penalties.\\n\\n\\nHey, that\\'s fine!  If a player does something stupid, he should be penalized\\nincluding Ulf.  Or Mario (you\\'re not likely to see that happen) or anyone else for that matter.  It\\'s pointless to say any one person is a cheap-shot goon,     because you\\'ll see EVERYONE take a cheap shot now and then, especially if you\\'resomeone who is shadowed as much as Ulf is.\\n\\n\\n\\nDetroit is a very disciplined team.  There\\'s a lot of Europeans\\nin Detroit which would make the game fast, so Toronto would have\\nto slow the game down, which means drawing penalties, as a last\\nresort anyway.  Toronto will be a good team as soon as they get\\nmore good players.  Toronto is just an average team, Detroit isn\\'t\\nBallard screwed Toronto when he was owner.  Everyone knows that.\\nand it\\'s going to take time for Toronto to become a real force.\\nI expect Gilmour to be burnt out next year.  He can\\'t pull the\\nwhole team forever.Hi.  According to my always questionable newspaper, there\\'s a silver\\ndollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the\\nanniversary of the Stanley Cup.  Now, I know full well what coins are\\nused every day in Canada.  I can easily fish a few out of my pocket\\nchange right now, in fact.  My question is, since the loon is the only\\ndollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative\\ncoin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort of\\nthing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no\\nchance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, what\\'s\\nthe current cost and what\\'s its potential value?  Just curious.  If no\\none knows, I\\'ll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or\\nwhatever it is).

I think it\\'s just 12 games into the season myself, so\\nI\\'m going to wait a bit before calling names.\\n\\n\\nI expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no\\nidea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to\\nrelease Otto if he doesn\\'t turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW,\\nOtto\\'s game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out\\na problem with the method since Otto\\'s performance was infinitely bad,\\nand excruciatingly prolonged.)\\n\\n\\nI think Merced\\'s rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren\\'t you willing to\\ngive him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting\\nso gloomy?\\n\\n\\nNo he didn\\'t.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when\\nthe league finally realizes this, it won\\'t be pretty at all.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which\\nwas a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors.\\nMeanwhile, I\\'m not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a\\nsix-year free agent before the 1992 season.\\n\\n\\nTwice through the rotation, and you\\'ve given up?  Yikes.\\n\\n\\nBut so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life\\nof a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can\\'t be much longer than a year.\\n\\n\\nBut he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his\\ndisastrous 1992.  I don\\'t think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign\\nhim.\\n\\n\\nHe certainly wasn\\'t last year.\\n\\n\\nHey, that\\'s the \"Skates Smith\" package deal.  Anybody who acquires\\nLonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is\\na real weirdo.\\n\\n\\nIf that\\'s the goal of the team ownership, than I don\\'t see why Sauer\\ngets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don\\'t know what he has or\\nhasn\\'t said about revenue sharing, so I can\\'t comment there.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them\\nto retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think\\nbigger accomplishments of Simmons\\' tenure were getting some value for\\nJohn Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch\\nlast year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something\\nin 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement\\nparts, which means that even if fail it hasn\\'t done serious damage to\\nthe Bucs\\' future.\\n\\n\\nDoes this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I\\nnever heard the outcome of this.  When will the final verdict be in on\\nthis?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don\\'t know who to\\nblame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.  In fact, I\\n*seriously* suspect it was Doug Danforth, who has shown his\\nwillingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is\\npointed at his feet.\\n\\n(btw--I\\'ve wondered whether my latest posts have been getting\\noff-site, so if somebody known to impersonate e.e. cummings can see\\nthis, would he drop me a short note?) \\n \\n Well, I\\'m a Wings fan and I think the FIRST thing that you should do is to\\nget the opponent\\'s line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone\\nwith them.  There is no Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert line, except for maybe on a\\npowerplay.  These three players usually play on three different lines.\\nWhich would mean that Toronto\\'s checking line would have to pull a triple\\nshift.\\nThe Wings\\' lines usually look like this:\\n \\n                      Gallant-Yzerman-Ciccarelli\\n \\n                      Kozlov-Fedorov-Drake\\n \\n                      Kennedy-Burr-Probert\\n \\n                      Ysebaert-Primeau-Sheppard\\n \\nOh by the way:  Start praying! : )\\n\\nI don\\'t really mind the length of games either.  If they want to speed\\nthe games up in sensible ways, that\\'s fine with me too.  However, what\\nI object to is the assertion by baseball people (Whitey Herzog, Buck\\nRodgers are who I\\'ve heard say this) that games are too long because\\nhitters are taking too many pitches, and that the strike zone needs to\\nbe expanded.\\n\\nOK, the Mets and O\\'s are good examples, but what about the \\'90 Reds?  Do you\\nreally think that anyone expected them to sweep the A\\'s?  I know people who\\ndidn\\'t even think they\\'d win a game, let alone win the Series.  We proved \\nthem wrong, though, didn\\'t we?\\n\\nAs for this year, ignore their record now.  They\\'ve had a rocky start, and\\nthat has nothing to do with Colorado.  They shall rise again.  The hunt for\\na Reds\\' October continues. (with all due respect to WLW)  Bye.\\n\\n\\nBefore I begin lambasting Don Cherry, let me first say that I\\'ve been sort of\\na Cherry fan for a while...admittedly stuff he says has to be taken lightly,\\nbut he\\'s more-or-less harmless.  On Saturday, however, he crossed the lines of\\ngood taste:\\n\\n\\nThis is the best he can do?!!  Gee Don, tremendous amounts of professionalism\\nhere.  The CBC looks just as bad as he looks foolish letting him get away with\\nthis nonsense...making fun of names??  It\\'s bad enough that he makes asinine\\nblanket statements about European players, but he\\'s now resorted to making fun\\nof their names too?  He sounded like an idiot, much like he did last week\\nwhen he said that Teemu would never make it to his \\'Rock \\'em, Sock \\'em\\' video\\nuntil he dropped the gloves...\\n\\n\\nWell, what he _said_ was that even though he\\'s been around the league for quite\\nsome time, he still doesn\\'t know who\\'s where w.r.t. conference and division\\nnames.  HELLO??!! McFly??  The names have been around for a couple of decades\\nor so....he also invited the audience to \"Name the teams in the Wales...quick,\\nquick!\" Followed by \"Ah, you don\\'t know, I don\\'t know....\"  \\n\\nSorry Don.  Wrong on this one.\\n\\n\\nThis was absolutely hilarious.\\n\\nDon\\'s argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly\\ngood...unfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in\\nthe NBA case.  Serious money...oh well, he\\'s never been one for objectivity,\\nhas he?\\n\\nDon\\'s question to Gretzky:\\nWhy did I get sucked into this?\\n\\n\\nAssuming you\\'re serious, I guess you\\'d be surprised to hear\\nthat us GUYS don\\'t think so. I would guess that a tiny fraction\\nof 1% of the folks reading your post agree with it. I kind of\\ndoubt that even you agree with it.\\n\\nI\\'m not going to go through your points one at a time, because, \\nafter all, not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball.\\n\\nI\\'m only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema, the\\nAAA umpire who sued (is suing?) baseball on the grounds of sex\\ndiscrimination because she wasn\\'t promoted to the majors.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience\\nwith her ability as an umpire.\\n\\nBut I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be\\nthat she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the\\numpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems\\nto me that she is missing the point and if that\\'s how she sees\\nthe role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn\\'t promote her\\neither.\\n\\nThe umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners\\nsafe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is\\nto maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the\\nplayers from trying to kill each other. \\n\\nUmpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most\\nof us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she\\ndeserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of\\nthe rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires\\nneed to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n Well, here in Detroit we get to see and hear Don Cherry quite regularly.\\nThe Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC (ch 9) in\\nWindsor where we see Don Cherry\\'s Coaches Corner between periods. We\\nalso get to see Don Cherry\\'s Grapevine just before the game. The\\nGrapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach\\nabout what else: Hockey.  It\\'s actually a pretty good show and Don\\nisn\\'t as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were\\nDon got his nickname \\'Grapes\\' but I\\'m not sure.  Don use to coach the\\nBoston Bruins.  I don\\'t know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill\\nme in on this info?\\n  A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday\\nmorning.  Personally, I\\'ve had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off\\nsometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave\\nhigh praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not\\njust a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player\\nin the game because of that.  That\\'s fine and I agree that Gilmour\\nis a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman\\nabout a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?\\n  It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from\\ncity to city.\\n  Don Cherry:  \\'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>\\n              is the best two-way player in the league today.\\'\\n \\n  There have been other times (can\\'t remember exactly what he said) that he\\nbasically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.\\n  Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario\\nLemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs\\nfrom the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the\\nWales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about\\nLemieux.  In my opinion, he is an ass.  And I won\\'t change my opinion\\nif I\\'m in a different city.\\n  Sorry, if this didn\\'t answer your question better but I just had to get\\nthis off my chest.\\nThat\\'s might be what it takes to beat the Braves this year.  \\n I know that there wasn\\'t other games on the schedule, but ESPN sometimes\\nshows classic games from previous season to fill in the time slot.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t understand this at all.  Matt Williams has demonstrated\\nthroughout his career that he will NOT wait for good pitches to hit.\\nHe won\\'t take walks.  He\\'d rather swing.  If I\\'m the opposing pitcher,\\nwhy would I groove a fastball to Williams and have him hit it well,\\nwhen I know that Williams will swing (and miss, or at least not hit\\nvery well) at a low and away curve?Hi all,\\n\\n\\tI got tired of waiting for a mailing list so I am going to make one....\\njust send me your complete e-mail address on your message and I\\'ll send\\nyou a confirmation and the Yankee mailing list address\\n\\n-john\\nHank Greenberg, Sid Gordon, Ron Blomberg.\\nProbably because everyone (that is, everyone who has cable) can watch\\nevery Braves game. They are the only team that has all of its games\\nbroadcast nationwide.

Range is\\nnot the only thing that makes a good firstbaseman. The ability\\nto field all sorts of balls thrown to him: digging some out of the\\ndirt, stretching for others, and so forth is important. Thus, \\nputouts do provide some information.  Maybe what we need is a\\ncomparision of how many balls were thrown to the area of the\\nfirst baseman vs. how many he actually got.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the new Buffalo one, the second since he\\'s been with the\\nSabres?

We surely don\\'t all get mailing lists about\\nthe teams about which we are most enthused.  So it seems to me r.s.baseball\\nis an appropriate place to look for information about teams one doesn\\'t\\nnecessarily follow day-to-day.\\n\\n\\tThis is not intended as flamage, but rather is an attempted answer,\\nas you posed your post as a question.\\nObviously, it is ultimately the teams choice...the NHL would obviously\\nprefer not to annoy the European hockey federations, but the NHL right\\nnow cannot force NHL teams to free their players...the Whalers probably\\ndid it this way so as to not annoy their farm team affiliate.UPI Clarinet has just relayed a \"scoop\" from the Toronto Sun\\n(or was that Star?  I like the Star myself ...) that Iron Mike\\nKeenan has come to an agreement with the New York Rangers for\\nnext season.  Interestingly, this comes the day after the Times\\nSports had an editorial about how the Rangers need their own\\nPat Riley ... who cares about what happens after next season?\\n\\ngldShowing a meaningless (relatively) baseball game over the overtime of\\ngame that was tied up with less than 3 seconds left on the clock?\\nGimme a break!  Where does ESPN get these BRILLIANT decisions from?: \\n: And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded, \\n: resigned, or been striped of his title during the season? Any other \\n: team captain trivia would be appreciated.\\n: \\n\\nLuc Robitaille was captain of the Kings the first third of the season,\\nuntil The Great One came back from his disc injury. It was kind of\\nawkward, but Melrose appointed (anointed?) TGO as captain immediately upon\\nhis return, after which he did not score a goal for something like 10\\ngames.\\n\\nI think Luc should have remained Captain all season.Vielen dank\\nDesperate Fan\\nYou\\'re definitely correct in that Williams absolutely has to be sandwiched\\nin between Clark and Bonds.  He must, and I mean MUST, get fastballs to\\nhit...otherwise he becomes little more than Sixto Lezcano in disguise.\\nWhat I would suggest is perhaps batting Bonds, Williams, and Clark\\n3-4-5, the reason being that I feel Bonds\\' potential basestealing\\nabilities are wasted when he\\'s stuck behind two slow runners.\\nI think the chance of getting 20-30 extra stolen bases with Bonds in the\\n3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having \\nClark in the 5 spot.\\nWhy?

I think Phil Plantier has the ugliest stance.  He looks like\\nhe\\'s sitting on the toilet.\\n\\nI know it\\'s very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris, but let\\'s give credit\\nwhere credit is due.\\n\\nIt is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris.\\nLast year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the \\nother starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge,\\nMorris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can\\'t remember exactly).\\nAlso, let\\'s not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save \\nthe bullpen every fifth day.  If he didn\\'t help us win the AL east, forget\\nabout the pennent and the world series.\\n\\nHis run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer\\'s (5.90 runs)\\nand he won only 12 games.  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of\\n6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as good\\nas he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise\\ncontrol and threw the ball up there and let the batters \"get themseleves out\"\\n(I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out \\ntrying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a \\nveteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in\\nbaseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra\\n(I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.\\n\\nYes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let\\'s not change history\\nto suit the present.  \\n\\nBTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a \\nveteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more\\ncan he be embarrassed?\\n\\n\\nditto!\\n\\nNo, Brian\\'s hurt.

None of my local bookstores have it.\\n\\n\\n\\tBaltimore Baseblazers? Where the hell did you come up with that? The\\nOrioles are not a base-stealing team except for Anderson. Besides we would\\nnever call them anything but the Baltimore Orioles. Why? The ballpark has\\nall these orthologically (spelling error?) correct BALTIMORE ORIOLES all\\nover the place. I bet you thought the bird is just an oriole. It\\'s not. The\\nbird was named after Lord Baltimore when Maryland was founded. They\\'re\\ncalled Baltimore Orioles. But the post is just a joke so why do I care what\\na non-O\\'s fan thinks of us? But I still wonder where Baseblazers came from.\\nSan Diego Padres, now there\\'s a name that needs to be changed. How is padre\\nbeing used? As \"Father\" ie priest or \"father\" ie parents?I thought that was Sandy Koufax.\\nI don\\'t personally, but Clay just posted it.  Yes, we do.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn\\'t as good an example as Nieves would\\nhave been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous\\nyears (which I didn\\'t have access to).\\n\\nThe point remains, though; knowing a guy\\'s minor league history is as good\\nas knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.\\n\\n\\nThe MLE is not a *projection*, it\\'s an *equivalence*.  It\\'s a \"this is how\\nwell he hit *last* year, in major league terms\" rating.  So, in essence, he\\nhas *already* reached it.  I would guess (Bob?  Clay?) that essentially half\\nof all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybe\\nmore than half, since all of these players are young and improving.\\n\\n\\nDid they?  Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place\\nand last place, but no more.\\n\\n\\nSure; they didn\\'t have anyone better.  I suppose they might have gutted the\\nfarm system to acquire Jay Bell or Spike Owen or somebody if they were really\\nin contention. \\n\\n\\nIf you\\'d read what I wrote, you\\'d be less amazed.  Nowhere do I claim to put\\nany credence in spring training.  Quite the contrary; I said that Lopez hadn\\'t\\ndone anything that even the bozos who *do* put credence in spring training\\ncould interpret as \"failure\".  Just because I think spring training numbers\\nare meaningless doesn\\'t mean that Bobby Cox does; it\\'s just a case of ruling\\nout one possible explanation for sending Lopez down.\\n\\n\\nKeith Mitchell did very very well at AA, AAA, and the majors over a season,\\nthen did very, very poorly for a year in AAA.\\n\\nAnd then cjkuo@symantec.com (Jimmy Kuo) quoth:\\n\\nWell, either way, the Reds have to play a man down for 3 days.\\n\\nSo in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out\\nthe Penguins, that\\'s immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on,\\nJoe, think about what you\\'re saying! Who they played is VERY significant.\\nWhy they played them is what\\'s irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams\\nis better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two\\ngoaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good\\nteams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context\\nof comparing two goaltenders.\\n\\n\\nYES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you\\'re a\\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn\\'t see the second Toronto\\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn\\'t tested. The same\\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\\n\\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\\nstand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\\ndoesn\\'t have a game like that in him.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about\\nRoussel, but they don\\'t say too much on the good side either. I\\'ve seen\\nat least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was\\nto have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,\\nDom has played well too.\\n\\n\\nFLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a\\nteam picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the\\nsame picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning,\\nKasper...\\n\\n\\nMostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain\\nautographs on the team photos. I don\\'t like that method since I\\'ve seen\\nguards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they\\ngot their hands on an autographed picture they\\'d hold \\'em for their buddies.\\nHindsight\\'s 20-20. Nobody expected Kisio to have his 2nd best career year.\\n\\n\\nI didn\\'t mean to imply that Gund\\'s offer wasn\\'t enough.  Gund\\'s offer\\nwas the right $, but too late in the season.  $2M offered in November\\nlets Sather buy a replacement for Murphy *this* season and make the\\nplayoffs *this* year. $2M in March doesn\\'t help Sather with his\\nimmediate objectives, doesn\\'t help with long term objectives (only a\\nprospect or draft pick does, and no way should the Sharks do that).\\nHowever, getting back to what-if games, had Kisio been traded to\\nChicago last year, then the Sharks go 0 for October, and maybe Gund\\npanicks sooner in November. And here\\'s another what-if twist: Chicago\\nwould have had Kisio this season; they *never* go after Murphy in the\\nfirst place because Kelly is having his *best* season (bigger guys in\\nChicago). So Gund has no competition. So Ferriera, Sather, and Keenan\\nall look like geniuses.\\n\\nA broken fax machine, and Ferriera, Keenan, and maybe Kingston\\n(and maybe even Green) lose their jobs. Kind of makes you\\nshiver doesn\\'t it. :-)\\n\\nBottomline, for every black scenario any of you can concoct for\\nKisio leaving, I can concoct an equally bright one.\\n\\n\\nAre you serious?\\n\\t- Let Ferierra go,\\n\\t- fire Kingston (these last two basically mean that\\n\\t\\tSharks are starting over again in terms of the\\n\\t\\ttimetable to capture the Cup. As I\\'ve stated\\n\\t\\tfrequently: 5 out 6 expansion teams had the same GM\\n\\t\\tfrom inception through Cup season)\\n\\n\\t- broadcast more home games than away games\\n\\t- broadcast very few road Pacific and Mountain time games\\n\\t- jack up my ticket prices from $27 to $38 in two years (not that I\\'m\\n\\t\\tgoing to pay 120 bucks for 3 seats.

Wirtz treats his fans far better by comparison. And\\nPocklington with his cheap tix is the best owner of all.\\n\\n\\nI know one isn\\'t suppose to make negative comments on signatures, but\\nwhat did us Oiler fans do to you to deserve the \"Stay in Edmonton\"\\npart? I\\'d never wish the Kings to leave metro-LA; it\\'s too much fun\\nwatching the Shark\\'s beat them.\\n\\nDid they move Probert back to defense?  Why did I see him parking his ass\\nin front of Potvin all night?  Somebody is going to have to discipline\\nProbert if the Leafs want to win the series.  Perhaps a fresh Clark should\\nhit the ice at the end of a long Probert shift and straigten him out for\\na while...\\n\\n\\n-- -=> Quoting The Logistician to All <=-\\n\\n \\n\\n TL> I am in need of all of the players wearing #77 in the NHL.

Whats the sports world coming to?\\n\\n    \\nHere is a press release from the White House.\\n\\n Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team\\nApril 19; Q&A Following\\n To: National Desk\\n Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100\\n\\n   WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript\\nof remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine \"Black\\nBears\" NCAA Division I hockey champions:\\n\\n                           The Rose Garden\\n\\n 9:58 A.M. EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It\\'s\\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\\na national championship.  And we\\'re glad to have them here.\\n\\n     I\\'m inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\\ncheer them onto victory.\\n\\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\\nback in 1978.  I\\'m sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\\n\\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\\npopular sport than hockey.  We don\\'t have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It\\'s a hard-hitting sport.  It does\\nhave one virtue though, there\\'s a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\\n\\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can\\'t imagine.  (Laughter.)  I\\'m\\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\\nthan me.\\n\\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\\nknow a little bit about.\\n\\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\\nbehind.\\n\\n     I think it\\'s important, as I ask young people from\\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\\nof our lives.\\n\\n     We now have another role model, and I\\'m glad to have\\nthem here today.  (Applause.)\\n\\n     (The President is presented with team jersey.)\\n(Applause.)\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That\\'s great.  I love it.  It\\'s beautiful.\\n(Applause.)\\n\\n     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That\\'s great.  (Applause.)\\n\\n                             * * * * * *\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco\\nthis morning, sir?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney\\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\\nto her and to the FBI.\\n\\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\\nshould be executed?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\\n\\n     Q  Is this a raid?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\\ndecisions.\\n\\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\\nmorning?\\n\\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\\n\\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\\nMitchell, he\\'s worth a quarter any day.\\n\\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we\\'re going to\\nhave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to\\ntalk.  And we agreed we\\'d get back together later, around noon, and\\ntalk some more.\\n\\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\\ncompromise is no compromise.\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\\nback to work.  I don\\'t want to go back and revisit every one, but you\\n\\n\\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\\nthey\\'re taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\\nto be paid for don\\'t have much of a history on which to base their\\nposition.  They\\'ve got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\\nwork.  So I think we\\'ve got a chance to work it out, and I\\'m hopeful.\\nWe\\'ll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I\\'m feeling pretty good\\nabout it.\\n\\n     THE PRESS:  Thank you\\n\\n                                 END       10:10 A.M.

After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the\\nmiddle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he\\nwouldn\\'t have had time to throw Riles out. Yet, the throw beat Riles\\nby about two steps. I wonder how many others who watched the final out\\nthink Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.\\nDoes anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? And\\nif he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an\\nerror or a hit? (Judging from Bosio\\'s grimace when the ball bounced\\npast him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) Whether\\nVizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\n--------------------------\\nPhil Brown                |\\naka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |Dunno about Miller.\\n\\nIf you mean Scott Erickson, currently the reigning Twins Least Consistent\\nGood Player, he pulled a muscle in the neighborhood of the rib cage that\\nmade it essentially impossible for him to pitch temporarily, and is\\nexpected back on the mound Sunday.\\nI\\'m familiar with the telethon situation (an individual on CompuServe\\nwas also victimized and was equally pissed).  That was a local\\ntelevision station contract which could not be broken.  For that item,\\nI strongly suggest you call that affiliate and vent your anger on\\nthem.  (Supposedly one station had told my friend that they have\\nreceived hundreds of angry calls which will translate into far less\\nincentive to pre-empt hockey telecasts in future.  The contract was\\nwritten when the pathetic WLAF was in that time slot.)\\nBowman is in the Hockey Hall of Fame as a coach already...and unlike\\nGil Stein...he didn\\'t get their by stacking the Board of Directors! -)\\n\\n\\nBowman is the genius...Johnson isn\\'t.

However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and\\nPatrick\\'s solution of having him only run the team on game days, and\\ndelegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is\\na shrewd managerial decision on Patrick\\'s part.  \\nI wholeheartedly endorse it.\\n\\n I have no problem with the\\n\\nHaven\\'t been to many A\\'s games, have you?\\n\\nSeriously, I don\\'t mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts\\na long time because there is good baseball being played.  However, I don\\'t\\nlike 3-2 games that take 3+ hours, because there\\'s a lot of dead time going\\non in that game.  I don\\'t find anything exciting about watching batter or\\npitcher wander around between pitches, or watching the catcher make a slow\\nwalk to the mound, or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason\\n(Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this; the game could be way out of\\nreach, and he\\'d still be making switches for platoon advantage).  \\n\\nI want to see the game, not people standing around.  I don\\'t really enjoy\\nwatching NFL football games in person, for example, because there\\'s so much\\ndead time (you don\\'t really notice how much dead time there is if you watch\\nit on television, because they\\'re busy showing you replays).  I don\\'t like\\nthat college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game\\n(the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next\\nyear: they\\'re going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next\\nyear, and they\\'re going to a 35 second clock).  \\n\\nThere\\'s also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I\\'m\\nwatching them on the tube, and if I\\'m going there in person.  For me, going\\nto an A\\'s game has become a major commitment of time, one that I\\'m not\\nwilling to make that often:  the length of their games is costing the A\\'s\\nrevenue from me.The Red Sox usually have 2 catchers.  I don\\'t think they have a backup now,\\nbut they used to use Randy Kutcher as a backup catcher, as well as a middle\\ninfielder and outfielder.  You don\\'t need a good 3rd catcher, just a\\ncompetent one, so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick\\na player who can be of use elsewhere on the field.\\n\\n\\nI was watching the Dodgers/Marlins game yesterday and a couple of\\nthings impressed me.  \\n\\nFirst is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer\\natmosphere in early spring for baseball.  In comparison Wrigley Field\\nin early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and\\nbundled up fans.  \\n\\nThe second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals!\\nI will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball.\\nIt was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to\\nthe Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the\\nAFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it,\\nbut I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with\\na lot of baseball fans in other cities.  \\n\\nBaseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion\\nteams bring back some excitement.  We\\'ll find out Friday how Denver\\nBronco fans respond. \\nI\\'m not sure about Juha, but another top center, Rauli Raitanen([ss{t)\\nis drafted by Jets. Raitanen had very good year and he has played in the\\nFinnish nationalteam. I believe that he\\'ll be one of the best finns in\\nthis year\\'s WC, if Matikainen(Head coach) elects him to the team.\\n\\n\\nAttention Penguins fans once again, apparently 99.999% of you understand that\\nthis was just a joke (Hence the :-) next to it) but one idiot on here doesn\\'t\\nas he got pissed at me and sent me two hate e-mails telling me that this is\\nwrong.  I have no intentions of sending e-mail to anyone should the Pens win\\ntonight, and I really do not expect/do not intend to lead any of you to send\\nthis poster e-mail either.  It was NOT a serious request.  If you didn\\'t know\\nthat (which you probably did) then don\\'t do it.

Bill James is a partial owner of STATS, inc.  However he has almost\\nnothing to do with the day-to-day operations of the company, although he\\ndoes have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name.\\n(The handbook, but not the scoreboard).  To the best of my knowledge, the\\nonly things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions section\\nof the handbook, and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook.\\n\\n2.) The debate over Elias goes way back.  Bill James\\' early stuff was hampered\\nby the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price.\\nProject Scoresheet, and later, STATS were founded to fill this void.  You\\ncan call STATS, and ask them for a report on just about anything in their\\ndatabase, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course.  Or you could\\njust log into their online system and look at the data yourself.  Having\\nattempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past (football, not baseball), they\\njust don\\'t do that.  In STATS eyes, the high ground comes from making the\\ninformation available at all.\\n\\n3.)  That being said, I\\'m pretty dissapointed by Bill\\'s book this year, too.\\nI am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers \\ndesire to have the book come out sooner than April.\\n\\nHope this makes things just a little bit clearer.\\n\\n(Bias alert.  I am a former part-time employee of STATS.)Lowenstein is NOT Jewish.  However, there is a long list including\\nHank Greenberg, Moe Berg, Rod Carew (a convert), the Sherry brothers,\\nArt Shamsky, and Ron Blomberg.Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.\\n \\nAstacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night.\\nIn the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then\\na single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the\\nthrow home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.\\n \\nLasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza\\nbatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder\\nand Webster.\\n \\nPiazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.\\nThe Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single\\nby Offerman.\\n \\nBy the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but\\nthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\\n \\nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\\n \\nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\\n \\nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\\n \\nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3\\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\\n \\nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\\nscored long before that.\\n \\nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this\\nup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year\\nhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs\\nof a sophomore jinx year.\\n \\nThe final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.\\nDodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.if\\nteam! \\nYeah but Soderstrom\\'s mask has always appeared to be a lot bigger than the  \\naverage helmet-and-cage variety.

Why don\\'t people think before they post?\\nJeez...\\n\\nOff and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and\\nrelated topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can \\npredict a player\\'s RBIs using information about his overall\\nperformance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)\\nthat he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This \\ncompletely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 \\ncould do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I\\'d\\ntake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to\\nthe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.\\n\\nI\\'ve started with team data, using data from the Elias\\'s that\\nI\\'ve picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and\\nb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias\\'s profits.\\nThat gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don\\'t \\nhave team RBIs for \\'87 or I could add that year.)  If you\\nrun a simple least squares fit to the data you get \\n\\n(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.\\n\\nThe correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is\\nsignificant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the\\nfit is good at the team level.  I\\'ve no started to move on to \\nthe player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,\\nOzzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to \\nadd quite a few more during my copious free time this year.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the\\nlow HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it\\ncould just be Ozzie.

Jay Bell was\\ngiven 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what\\nyou would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the\\nnext year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at\\nage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,\\nand has been there ever since.  It\\'s really hard for me to see where he\\nwould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was\\nperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \"rushed\";\\nCleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have\\nbeen less likely to give up on him.\\n\\nYes, if you bring a player up early, he\\'s likely going to struggle.  But\\ndoes that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts\\nperforming up to expectations?\\nOh, come on.  Everybody on the net has heard about \"plausible deniability\".\\nYou\\'re not fooling anybody.\\n\\n\\nNote how quick Vince was to make the inference that my post claimed\\nthat Mulroney was smiling at the baseballistics news.  This sure looks\\nlike guilty knowledge to me...\\n\\n                                    ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^\\nI.e., the $300 grand.\\n\\n\\nThe early money has to be on \"Tom Tom\" Bolton, who contributed that\\nclutch grandslam in his first appearance.  But I expect lots of\\nstrong contenders this year, many of them right here in San Diego.GAME(S) OF 4/15\\n---------------\\nADIRONDACK 6\\tCDI 2\\t(Adirondack leads series, 1-0)\\n\\n=================================================\\t\\t\\t\\nFIRST ROUND\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSpringfield Indians vs Providence Bruins\\nGm 1:\\tSpringfield 3\\tPROVIDENCE 2\\t\\nGm 2:\\tSpringfield 5\\tPROVIDENCE 4\\nGm 3:\\t4/16\\tProvidence at Springfield\\nGm 4:\\t4/17\\tProvidence at Springfield\\nGm 5:\\t4/22\\tSpringfield at Providence\\t*\\nGm 6:\\t4/24\\tProvidence at Springfield\\t*\\nGm 7:\\t4/27\\tSpringfield at Providence\\t*\\n\\nCD Islanders vs Adirondack Red Wings\\nGm 1:\\tADIRONDACK 6\\tCDI 2\\nGm 2:\\t4/17\\tCDI at Adirondack\\nGm 3:\\t4/18\\tAdirondack at CDI\\nGm 4:\\t4/21\\tAdirondack at CDI\\nGm 5:\\t4/23\\tCDI at Adirondack\\t*\\nGm 6:\\t4/24\\tAdirondack at CDI\\t*\\nGm 7:\\t4/26\\tCDI at Adirondack\\t*\\n\\nBaltimore Skipjacks at Binghamton Rangers\\nGm 1:\\t4/16\\tBaltimore at Binghamton\\nGm 2:\\t4/17\\tBaltimore at Binghamton\\nGm 3:\\t4/23\\tBinghamton at Baltimore\\nGm 4:\\t4/24\\tBinghamton at Baltimore\\nGm 5:\\t4/26\\tBaltimore at Binghamton\\t*\\nGm 6:\\t4/28\\tBinghmaton at Baltimore\\t*\\nGm 7:\\t4/30\\tBaltimore at Binghamton\\t*\\n\\nUtica Devils vs Rochester Americans\\nGm 1:\\t4/16\\tUtica at Rochester\\nGm 2:\\t4/17\\tUtica at Rochester\\nGm 3:\\t4/20\\tRochester at Utica\\nGm 4:\\t4/22\\tRochester at Utica\\nGm 5:\\t4/24\\tUtica at Rochester\\t*\\nGm 6:\\t4/26\\tRochester at Utica\\t*\\nGm 7:\\t4/28\\tUtica at Rochester\\t*\\n\\nMoncton Hawks vs St John\\'s Maple Leafs\\nGm 1:\\tSt John\\'s 4\\tMoncton 2\\nGm 2:\\t4/17\\tMoncton vs St John\\'s at Halifax\\nGm 3:\\t4/21\\tSt John\\'s at Moncton\\nGm 4:\\t4/23\\tSt John\\'s at Moncton\\nGm 5:\\t4/26\\tMoncton vs St John\\'s at Halifax\\t*\\nGm 6:\\t4/28\\tSt John\\'s at Moncton\\t\\t*\\nGm 7:\\t4/30\\tMoncton vs St John\\'s at Halifax\\t*\\n\\nCape Breton Oilers vs Fredericton Canadiens\\nGm 1:\\tFredericton 4\\tCape Breton 3\\t(2OT)\\nGm 2:\\t4/16\\tCape Breton at Fredericton\\t\\nGm 3:\\t4/20\\tFredericton at Cape Breton\\nGm 4:\\t4/22\\tFredericton at Cape Breton\\nGm 5:\\t4/24\\tCape Breton at Fredericton\\t*\\nGm 6:\\t4/26\\tFredericton at Cape Breton\\t*\\nGm 7:\\t4/28\\tCape Breton at Fredericton\\t*\\n\\nWell, so are we, and we see it completely different than you.

He has shown demonstrated excellent speed.\\n\\nFinally, the Sabres appear to have shown up for the post season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDJ was a popular player in San Diego, Derek Bell was not faring well in the\\nclubhouse at Toronto, so no matter how bad he looks now I still think it\\nwas a steal for the Jays just from the perspective of team chemistry.\\nNo statistic can describe it (sorry statheads) and since there are so many\\nnew faces in the clubhouse I think the Jays are still trying to find it.\\n\\n(Insert the same comment into the Jack Morris v. Clemens WS Ring string)\\n\\nYet at first I was sad to see Derek go, still anticipating all of the talent\\nthey raved about at the beginning of last season.  I\\'m glad to see him\\nfaring well for the Padres though.\\nWell, here it is, NHL in the year 2000.\\nI got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and \\nalthough I initially thought I had just been taking too many too strong \\ndrugs now it seems the realization has really begun...  You can see the \\nleague has already started to move to this direction.\\n\\n   *The Walt Disney Conference*\\nAnaheim Mighty Chipmunks    -Franchise name to be changed after each new \\nLA Kings                      hockey movie         \\nLA Flames                   -We\\'ve seen some of that\\nSan Jose Sharks\\nSan Diego Bruins\\nTijuana Red Wings   -Detroit\\'s hockey team will follow its car industry...\\nDallas Stars           \\nHouston Oilers\\nTexas Rangers\\nSeattle Canucks\\n\\n   *The Norm Green Conference*\\nAlabama White Hawks\\nBiloxi Blues\\nTampa Bay Lightning\\nMiami Blades\\nHelsinki Jets        -You\\'ve heard them starting getting used to the anthem\\nMontreal Quebecois (sp?)                 -There will be no \\'Canada\\'\\nAtlanta Devils\\nOrlando Penquins\\nKey West Islanders\\nHartford Whalers                        The Whalers will never move, huh?\\nPalm Beach Capitals\\n\\n  Now that the Anahaim team is becomming real I\\'m really beginning to believe\\nthe rest of the \\'message\\'.  I\\'m sure the future will turn you into believers \\ntoo.  After 2000 the NHL will abandond ice-rinks.  It\\'s so expensive to cool \\ndown the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is \\nanyway.  NHL will become a roller skating hockey league.  That way it can \\ncreate more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the \\ngame in their back yards !\\n\\nI\\'m not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in\\na neutral park Bo\\'s HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\\n\\nOne thing, when looking at Bo\\'s stats, is that you can see that KC took\\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \\nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \\n\\n\\nFelix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.\\nI would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.\\nMaybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.\\n\\n\\nI\\'d put him about there too.  \\n\\nNote: I hadn\\'t realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he\\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \\nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn\\'t\\nwinning.\\n\\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\\nmistake being made (by the SDCN\\'s, as they are known, on this group)\\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\\n\\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\\n\\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\\na player with poor MLE\\'s (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don\\'t (Oddibe\\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn\\'t hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\\nand so on.\\n\\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\\n\\nWhat hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player\\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players.\\n(It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after\\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don\\'t mean what they usually mean?\\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \\n\\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE\\'s.  But you guys DON\\'T KNOW.  What\\'s \\nworse, you don\\'t know that you don\\'t.  And you don\\'t know that there are \\nother players you won\\'t know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \\nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It\\'s not.\\nIt\\'s got some error.\\n\\nOh well.\\n\\nBill Guilford\\nNah, let\\'s reserve rec.sports.idiots for people who POST\\nobvious flamebait, like yourself.\\n\\nIf someone posts something as controversial (not to mention\\nidiotic) as what Austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup,\\nsomeone should challenge the statement.  There is a school\\nof thought that suggests that silence = consent.  Whereas\\nthis idea may not apply to everything in life, it certainly\\nSHOULD apply to a forum of public discussion, which r.s.b.\\nis.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve been reading r.s.b. lately, you\\'ll find\\nthat even elementary school children have had access\\nto our postings, alibet in an edited form.  It\\'s making me\\nthink a little more carefully about some of the things I post.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if someone like Austin wants to post his drivel\\nin some obscure newsgroup that I don\\'t read, fine.  He\\'s got the\\nright to rant, rave, and drool all he wants to in the name\\nof free speech.  But if he drools in a newsgroup that I read,\\nthen I will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal\\nto his drooling.\\n\\nNow, of course, you don\\'t have to read any of this.\\nAnd if you want to cut down on flames, then\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDON\\'T POST FLAMEBAIT!\\n(You don\\'t have to respond to flames, either.  Saves cyberspace)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats for\\nKansas City, you\\'ll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having\\nplayed in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the\\n4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.\\n\\n\\nWell, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn\\'t quite\\naccurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,\\nwhich was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because\\nhe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn\\'t disclose it, the Sharks and\\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\\nno-no).\\n\\nVery nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was\\nhurt. I expect he\\'ll surface with another team at some point (probably\\nanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of\\nhis career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players\\nmotivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a\\nbad judgement call.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlways gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but\\nhustle isn\\'t always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me\\none night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to\\nhold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto\\'s\\nneck and another wrapped around Otto\\'s stick arm. Otto casually turned\\naround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter\\nwasn\\'t there. Hustle can only cover size so far.\\n\\nThe Sharks have told me, point blank, that he\\'s gone for good (ditto HUbie\\nMcDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me\\n\"you have to make room for the kids\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to\\nK.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto\\nretirement, but I haven\\'t heard anything official. His only hope in hockey\\nnow is the Gulls.\\n\\n\\n\\nBecause, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked\\nfairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn\\'t think he\\nwas quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.\\n\\n\\nAgreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you\\nwish they\\'d performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you\\ncan really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have\\ntrouble, since you don\\'t see the off-puck action. your views from home and\\nmy views from the ice differ in numerous ways)\\n\\n\\n\\nCoffee. Coffey is with the Red Wings.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou? Nah... \\n\\nHe was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, as\\nfew games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate\\nto judge the talent too quickly.

(Why?\\nBecause it\\'s Monday and I didn\\'t feel like writing any REAL code...)\\n\\nAnyway, after I wiped out the 60-odd goalies in the list, I came up with:\\n\\nNHL average:\\t\\t55 GP      11 G      19 A      30 Pts      69 PIM\\n\\nThen I passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who\\nhad the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories.\\n\\nMarty McInnis (NYI)\\t56 GP (1%) 10 G (9%) 20 A (5%) 30 Pts (0%) 24 PIM (65%)\\nIgor Kravchuk (EDM)\\t55 GP (0%) 10 G (9%) 17 A (10%) 27 Pts (9%) 27 PIM (53%)\\n\\nThese two are close in games, goals, assists, and points, but are too far off\\nin PIM.

I\\'m hoping I can get a\\nreading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas.\\n\\nI\\'ve been under the impression that Minnesota was one of, or possibly,\\nTHE hockey state in the U.S.  So why is the team moving to a city in\\nTexas?  Is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, or\\nwere the Stars really not making a profit?  Or was the city or whoever\\nowned the arena doing some price gouging?\\n\\nAs much as I\\'d like to see the NHL only a 3 hour drive from me, I\\ncan\\'t help but feel for the people in Minnesota, unless they truly\\ndidn\\'t support the team.  \\n\\nOpinions, please.\\n\\n\\nYou haven\\'t been facing major league pitching.      \\n\\n  Maybe more... you have to be good at the plate, and most\\n\\nSTATS did a little study in the 1993 Scoreboard book entitled \"Can\\nyou hit sacrifice flies on purpose?\"  A summary of the findings:\\n\\nOver the 5 year period, sac-fly type fly balls were produced 17.6\\npercent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful, and \\n17.7 percent of the time when a sac fly wasn\\'t useful.\\n\\nThey looked at the leaders in sac flies, and found that the leaders\\nin sac flies - in other words, the guys you would expect to be good\\nat it it - hit sac fly type fly balls only 3% more often when they\\nneeded to - a difference way too small to be the result of a skill.\\nEssentially, the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do\\nso because they hit hit sac fly type flies often, with and without\\na runner on third.\\n\\nSTATS concludes \"So it appears conclusive that hitters cannot hit\\nsacrifice flies on purpose - even if they practice in the bATTING\\ncage.\"boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report.\\n\\nThe Wings player was Yves Racine, and he returned later in that same period.I stopped going to A\\'s games some years ago while I still lived inthe\\nBay Area for exactly this reason.  I believe the length of their games\\nhas been institutionalized by LaRussa/Duncan.  They encourage their\\npitchers to be overly deliberate, to throw to first often, to study\\nthe catchers\\' signals, and so on.  And almost every A\\'s hitter takes\\na step out of the box after every pitch.  This is not, imo, a coincidence.\\nThis is planned.  And I hate it.\\n\\nAs for the Gant situation, I did not see the game or the replays.  But\\nI do wonder.  What if Gant had requested a time out?  Would Hirschbeck\\nhave been required to give it to him?  Could he have denied the requst?\\nFor all he (the ump) knew, Gant could have had dirt in his eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tNo, no no. The Ack man is apparently an alien life-form, much\\nlike the pod people from planet Mars, who can take on any form (the\\nability remains the same, however). The Ack-people have been spotted on\\nmany teams to date, but it appears that the Orioles staff (mentioned\\nabove) and the Expos bullpen (Barnes, Walton, Fassero, Gardiner and\\nRojas) have been the prime target. Apparently John Wetteland was roughed\\nup by the Ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his\\nsystem rejected the takeover, and has been on the DL ever since. Contact\\nthe authorities! This evil plot must be stopped! (the Ack-people can\\nkeep Jack Morris and Juan Guzman, though. I enjoy watching Toronto fans\\nsuffer too much to want these guys returned to normal ;-)\\n\\nScot.\\n\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nScot Hughes        | Department of Chemical Engineering | Expos in \\'93!\\nfalcon@cs.mcgill.ca| McGill University, Montreal, Quebec| {witty saying here}\\t\\t     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIs this Tony Esposito?

And the rest of the\\nmatchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.\\n\\n\\nAgreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or\\ndoes everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!\\n\\nFinal\\n\\nI can\\'t predict a Montreal victory because I\\'ve been watching them play for\\n6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play\\nin the Garden.  Last time they beat the B\\'s 5-2 but Boston had a clear\\nterritorial advantage; the victory was Roy\\'s.  At the same time, I can\\'t\\nbring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I\\'ll just say I will\\nnot be putting money on this series. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\nAgreed.  NY doesn\\'t have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent\\nof the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is\\ncredit to NY.\\n\\n\\nAgreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent\\nteam, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.\\n\\n\\nI think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don\\'t\\nthink it will go six either...*maybe* five.\\n\\n\\nIf Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They\\nown the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once\\nagain I won\\'t be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the\\nHabs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.\\n\\n\\n\\nChicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good,\\nIMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.\\n\\n\\nVery true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out\\nwhy Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three \\nat MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.\\n\\n\\nIt _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. \\nAnd yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don\\'t use their\\nsize *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team\\nchasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.\\n\\n\\nThis is also tough for me to call, because I haven\\'t seen the Smythe enough. \\nI don\\'t think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a\\nnon-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate\\nGretzky.  LA in six.\\n\\n\\nIf it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be\\nLA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.\\n\\n\\nWow, must\\'ve been tough to go against your team.  But let\\'s see, I picked\\nLA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.\\n\\n\\nIf Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn\\'t bet\\nagainst the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong\\nbecause they\\'ve been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,\\nthough, I\\'d have to take the Penguins.\\n\\nA side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than\\nGilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from\\nthe age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.\\nI\\'m not asking for flames, either, btw....I\\'ve spent more than enough time\\narguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he\\'s a great player.  But while\\nhe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),\\nGilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.\\nfrom Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud\\nyour judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best\\nall-round players in the NHL.\\n\\nHere are the final stats for the CHL for the 1992-1993 season.\\n\\n                       Central Hockey League\\n\\n                       5840 S.

You see, the same rights Ali has to mail her letter to the NHL\\nare the same ones that let you post replies that mow her down like\\nwheat at harvest-time.  She never said she represented the entire\\ninternet or the entire group rec.sport.hockey.  She has every right to\\nstate her opinion along with those of the fifty or sixty or\\nhundred-odd folk who\\'ve agreed to allow her to list their names on the\\nbottom of it.  You may not agree with it.  Fine.  I really don\\'t care\\nenough about the name change to care.  Your name isn\\'t attached to it,\\nso why moan and complain?  If you felt her words were leading, well,\\nyou\\'re free to feel that way and take exception, but manners never\\nhurt.  I personally disagree and feel her generalizations were fine\\n(I have the right to think and say that, too).  Ali\\'s under no\\ncompunction to change a single word.  Now, while you\\'re free to\\ndisagree with every word she wrote, to tear apart her character is\\nuncalled for.  I\\'m posting this as a form of public reprimand.  If you\\ntear down Ali\\'s integrity and character publicly, you\\'ll get chastised\\npublicly in return.  Would it have been so hard to say, \"Ali, please\\nbe a bit more specific in your description, the way I\\'ve read it\\nindicates you\\'re stating my view also, and that\\'s simply not true.\\nI\\'d really like to see a disclaimer noting that you don\\'t mean the\\nentire internet or the entire r.s.h. group attached to it, despite\\nyour intent to list names at the bottom.  Thanks.  Cordially as\\nalways,\" &c.  Calling her a moron and an asshole just reduces the\\nweight of your words and the opinions of their author in the eyes of\\nmyself, and possibly others.  \\n\\nOh, and Ali, nice to see someone standing up for something, even if\\nit\\'s not something I personally advocate.  :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s not inner calm.

I thought that\\'s\\nwhy Gant was asking for the appeal to the 1st base umpire;\\nhe thought Hirschbeck had gotten checked-swing help from the wrong\\numpire.\\n\\n\\nAfter Hirschbeck called for the pitch, but before the pitch was thrown,\\nCox came onto the field.  It was obvious that he was trying to get time\\ncalled before the pitch, but no one was watching.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour listing pretty much agreed with what I saw, with the aforementioned\\naddendums.  Perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark.  Personally,\\nI was amazed that Gant didn\\'t get ejected.  But that\\'s why Cox did;\\nit\\'s called protecting your players.\\n\\nAnd to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game,\\nall I can say is that you\\'d be making baseball history.  Even in\\nthe worst baseball brawls, usually only the major instigators are\\nejected, not everyone who comes onto the field.  And I\\'d have to \\nsay that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game\\n than what the Braves did Fri. night.\\n\\nAnyhow, that\\'s my last two cents on the subject, barring\\noutrageous postings.  I will try to keep my eyes open\\nfor more incidents involving Hirschbeck. I think there will\\nbe some with other teams as well.  I hope not.OK, OK, OK. First, my apologies for perhaps being untimely with this subject material and perhaps overly optimistic in my request, but here goes anyhow:\\n\\nI\\'m *very* interested in finding out how I might be able to get two tickets for the All Star game in Baltimore this year. My very aged folks live about 50 miles away and I know it would be a great thing for them to attend the game. I went with them, and my grandfather who got me into baseball as a small child, to the All Star game in DC many years ago. Although I\\'m now in the SF Bay Area, I\\'d *love* to be able to treat my folks to this game; it\\'s absolutely the last chance they\\'d ever have to attend this g\\n\\n\\n\\n\\name locally.\\n\\nAny info would be greatly appreciated!!!!\\nSuch as?Picture if you will, the Habs going into the last couple minutes of the\\ngame, leading 2-0.  The Nords get a power play, pull Hextall, and get\\na goal.  Bout a minute later, they get another one.  Then they win in\\novertime......\\n\\nA bad dream?.......\\n\\nHow\\'s that Red Hot Chili Peppers song go...\\n\"Give it away,give it away, give it away now....\"\\n\\nOh well.  Suppose I can always watch the Leafs win tomorrow night....\\n   (smilies.....)\\n\\nAm I the only female hockey fan in the world?\\n\\n\"Deeply rooted rivalry?\" Ahem, Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined\\nthe top flight only in the early \\'70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since\\n1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think\\nyou\\'re exagerating here.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian &\\nAmerican Olympic teams have been . . . and they\\'ve had to play according to our\\nset of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about\\nas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean\\nBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in\\nthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn \\nMcEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been \\n3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the \\nKings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I\\'m sure that an All-Star team assembled\\nfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford \\nor Tampa Bay currently are doing.\\n---\\nBut what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up\\nwith Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and\\nno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? \\nHere is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:\\n\\n(28-30=superstar)\\n(23-27=star)\\n(18-22=NHL regular+)\\n(13-17=NHL regular)\\n( 8-12=role player)\\n\\nFINLAND:  \\n\\nD-Jyrki Lumme.......20\\nD-Teppo Numminen....20\\nD-Peter Ahola.......13\\n\\nC-Jari Kurri........25\\nC-Christian Ruuttu..16\\n\\nR-Teemu Selanne.....27\\n\\nL-Esa Tikkanen......20\\n(Obviously, Selanne\\'s ratings would be higher today than they were in January)\\n\\nSWEDEN:\\nD-Ulf Samuelsson....21\\nD-Fredrik Olausson..20\\nD-Niklas Lidstrom...18\\nD-Calle Johansson...18\\nD-Kjell Samuelsson..17\\nD-Tommy Sjodin......13\\nD-Tommy Albelin......7\\n\\nC-Mats Sundin.......26\\nC-Thomas Steen......18\\n\\nR-Thomas Sandstrom..22\\nR-Ulf Dahlen........18\\nR-Michael Nylander..13\\n\\nL-Per-Erik Eklund...18\\nL-Johan Garpenlov...16\\nL-Mikael Andersson..15\\nL-Jan Erixon........14\\n\\nThis would be interesting. Clearly, Finland\\'s top five players (Winnipeg\\'s\\nSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver\\'s Lumme, Los Angeles\\' Jari Kurri and New York\\'s\\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But\\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There\\'s\\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn\\'t be superstars at\\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\\n---\\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa\\'s 22 top\\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \\nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\\nisn\\'t completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\\nwon\\'t have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \\nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \\ncouple of years the same way Edmonton\\'s \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late \\'80s. \\nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \\nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I\\'d settle for a \\ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \\nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \\nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone. \\n\\n\\nClose, but there\\'s a number 3 also:\\n\\n3. have entered the game with no more than a 3 run lead and pitched\\n   at least one inning.\\n\\nIf a pitcher finishes a game which his team has won, does not get the win,\\nand satisfies at least one of the three requirements, he gets a save.\\n\\n-Rusty\\n-- NOTE: Saturday, April 20th\\'s scores should be sent out by this coming Friday.\\n\\n\\t     MLB Standings and Scores for Tuesday, April 20th, 1993\\n\\t                   (including yesterday\\'s games)\\n\\nNATIONAL WEST\\t      Won  Lost   Pct.

W. Behrens\\nbehrens@cc.swarthmore.edu\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'d walk through hell in a gasoline suit to keep playing baseball.\"  \\nOh... I forgot... Art Shamsky, former Red and Mets player.  Batted .301\\nbetween injuries in 1969 (fell short of qualifying for Top 10 because of\\ninjuries and platoon with Ron Swoboda; no Swobo wasn\\'t Jewish).The *real* way to speed up ballgames is for each home park owner to offer the\\nfollowing schedule of bonuses to players on *both* teams:\\n\\n   For all players who participated in the game, offer $500 for each 10\\n   minutes less than 3 hours the game took (i.e. if the game only took 2.5\\n   hours, each player gets a bonus of $1500).\\n\\n   For all pitchers throwing 3 or more full innings in the game, extrapolate\\n   the number of pitches or attempted pickoffs to the number they would have\\n   thrown in a full 9 innings, and offer $500 for each number less than 120.\\n   (If the pitcher throws a complete game with 100 pitches and 5 throws to\\n   first he would get $7500).\\n\\nI suspect you could finance this the same way Presidential campaigns are\\npaid for. Offer each fan a checkoff on his or her ticket that says \"I want\\n5% of the price of this ticket to go towards fast game bonuses\"...\\n\\nInteresting! One of our German friends here (Robert?) told me their forwards\\nwere all Canadian-Germans. Perhaps somebody can sort this out for us?\\n \\n\\nOK, \"this ain\\'t North America\" and so on, but I still doubt that _any_ city\\nhaving a pop. of 500,000 and below could support an NHL team. Of course,\\nSwitzerland probably should be judged as one large city because of small\\ndistances between cities but still. \\n\\n\\nDusseldorf? YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind one\\nof the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!). Cologne\\'s arena only seats about\\n7,000-8,000, Berlin is about 6,000 and no new facility will be built\\nunless their Olympic bid is successful. Munich does have an arena. \\n\\n\\nMalmo is big enough, but they also need a new arena...the current one has \\n5,000 seats I think.\\n\\n\\nIf we\\'re talking about the NHL, even Helsinki would struggle to make it work.\\nTurku (despite an excellent arena) and Tampere are nowhere near big enough for\\nmajor league hockey.\\n\\n\\n...Rome and the south are out of the question; this could as well be Africa\\nto hockey fans. Romans were given the chance to host some WC\\'94 games but\\nshowed no interest whatsoever. All teams in the Italian league come from Milan\\nand the smaller cities in the north.\\n\\n\\nParis had their own \"Volans Francais\"(sp) pro team a couple of years ago.\\nI believe they even made it to the European Club Championship finals \\ntournament one year, but eventually folded due to lower-than-hoped-for \\nattendances. The remaining cities seem to be too small to support a minor \\nsport like hockey.\\n\\n\\nThe easter cities lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey.\\n\\n\\nPerhaps . . . Most European teams will have to be like the Tampa Bay Lightning\\nanyway; playing in a small 10,000 seat arena, backed by Japanese money, run by \\nenthusiasts (Phil Esposito), heavy\\nmarketing, fans that have difficulty telling what \"icing\" means... London has\\nbeen mentioned, Sheffield and Birmingham also have large arenas and a new\\nmega-facility (16,000 seats!) might be built in Bristol in a couple of years.\\n\\n\\nNo facilities to speak of; their biggest arena (in Eindhoven) seats 2,500 \\nfans for hockey. \\n\\nMy vote goes for the (\\'75?) Indians with their all-red uniforms.\\nBoog Powell once said he felt like a big red blood clot.\\n\\nAnd some comments, with some players deleted.\\n\\n\\nYep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the\\n#1 spot.\\n\\nIt\\'s no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first\\nand second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points\\nhigher in both leagues than any other year.\\n\\nLooks good.  Too bad he\\'s moving to short.\\n\\nHighest five-year regular, though he\\'s only had one year as good as Kevin\\nMitchell :->.\\n\\nThe other elite fielders in the league.\\n\\nThis is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average.\\nHis 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of\\nthat may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the\\nPadres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and\\njudging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play\\nthird.\\n\\nAdd another to the elite fielders list.\\n\\nToo fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don\\'t know\\nwhat happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low\\n1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988\\n(best year ever) brings his average up a lot.\\n\\nStrange last two years.\\n\\nAccording to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base.\\nBut at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).\\n\\nBoggs has been pretty good.  I don\\'t know what happened in 1990, but every\\nother year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.\\n\\nLast year -- a fluke or a portent?\\n\\nWhy is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close\\nto one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?\\n\\nBrook  is declining.\\n\\nThree first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I\\'m not sure why Jefferies\\ngets all the grief about his fielding.  He\\'s never had a good year, but while\\nat second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder\\nat third.\\n\\nZeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he\\'s about\\n10 points below average.  And it\\'s probably not just the park, since Terry\\nPendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.\\n\\nMoving back to second was a good idea.\\n\\nSo why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He\\'s had a grand total\\nof one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.\\n\\nHoward Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit,\\nHoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn\\'t even break\\nthe .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.\\n\\nGood hitter, but his fielding needs work.\\n\\nNot a good fielder.\\n\\nBoth are better off at shortstop.\\n\\nTwo consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn\\'t seem to\\nhave helped his fielding any.  \\n\\nTexas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest\\nDA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean.\\n-- \\nDale J. Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Grad Student At Large\\nI agree that Keenan is an excellent choice.  Did you see Mike\\nLupica\\'s column in Sunday\\'s news?  My sentiments exactly.  I\\nthink he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire\\ninto their hearts next season.  Either that or he\\'s going to \\nbe kicking alot of butt!\\n\\n\\nI\\'m here, but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly\\nquiet (you know, doing the \"lurking\" thing).  I don\\'t have a\\nsense how many Rangers fans there are on the list either.  I \\nam a die-hard Ranger fan (I guess I have to be - I sat in the\\nGarden throughout the Penguins\\' - led by Mario\\'s 5 goals - decimation \\nof them on 4/9), but am sick at the abundance of talent that has\\nbeen totally untapped, and the lack of heart displayed this\\nseason.\\n\\n\\nHurlbut was injured for quite a while.  I\\'m not sure, but I\\nthink he may have recovered in time for the playoff run, and\\nif so, like you, question why he wasn\\'t used.\\n\\n\\nI believe Kocur was used, in many instances, for his intimidation \\nfactor.  Granted, he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for \\nthat reason alone, but you have to realize that when a team is\\nnot doing any REAL physical intimidation (I\\'d like to have a nickel \\nfor every time J.D. said \\'They\\'ve got to take the body more\\'), \\nyou\\'ve got to at least have some illusions ;-(\\n\\n\\nI agree and I don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\nSorry, I don\\'t agree with you here.  I think Joey C. did a good\\njob filling in when he was asked to.  I can\\'t imagine that it\\'s\\neasy going from near 0 ice time to being a full timer.  I don\\'t\\nseem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too\\nmuch, or failing to clear the zone.  He worked hard, and at\\nleast didn\\'t make any rookie mistakes.  As he said himself in an\\ninterview, he can only give what he has.  and he did.  \\n\\n\\nAbsolutely.  I think attendance at the Garden was better on the\\nlast day of the season, than any average night for the\\nIslanders.\\n\\n\\nThe man is awesome.  In a way, I\\'m enjoying the playoffs more,\\nnow that the Rangers aren\\'t in them.  I can really appreciate\\nall the glory Mario is getting without \\'hating\\' him because he\\'s\\non the opposing team.  He deserves it all, as far as I\\'m\\nconcerned.\\n\\n\\t\\t- MaryAt the Lester Patrick Awards lunch, Bill Torrey mentioned that one of his\\noptions next season is to be president of the Miami team, with Bob Clarke\\nworking for him.  At the same dinner, Clarke said that his worst mistake\\nin Philadelphia was letting Mike Keenan go -- in retrospect, almost all\\nplayers came realize that Keenan knew what it took to win.  Rumours are\\nnow circulating that Keenan will be back with the Flyers.\\n\\nNick Polano is sick of being a scapegoat for the schedule made for the\\nRed Wings; After all, Bryan Murray approved it.\\n\\nGerry Meehan and John Muckler are worried over the Sabres\\' prospects;\\nAssistant Don Lever says that the Sabres have to get their share now,\\nbecause a Quebec dynasty is emerging ...\\n\\nThe Mighty Ducks have declared that they will not throw money around\\nloosely to buy a team.\\n\\nOilers coach Ted Green remarked that \"There some guys around who can\\nfill Tie Domi\\'s skates, but none who can fill his helmet.\"\\n\\nSenators\\' Andrew McBain told off a security guard at Chicago Stadium\\nwho warned him of the stairs leading down to the locker room; McBain\\nmouthed off at him, after all being a seasoned professional ... and\\ntumbled down the entire steep flight.\\n\\ngld\\nWell what do you expect...Burns was playing him with Krushelnyski\\nand Baumgartner...Anderson is a finisher...unless you play him with\\nsomeone to can get him the puck in a finishing position...he ain\\'t\\ngoing to do much scoring!Well, I\\'m back from Tokyo, so here

                   | andrew@idacom.hp.com\\nHP IDACOM Telecom Operation     | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253Just some thoughts:\\n\\nI don\\'t usually like to post simply to make fun of a player,\\nbut this time I couldn\\'t resist.  During the Pens-Devils game\\nlast night, second period, I think Kevin Stevens was in the\\npenalty box, Nicholls punched Kjell Samuellson in the face,\\nthen raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend\\nhimself!  All Kjell could do, at 8\\'7\" and 355 pounds, was laugh!\\n\\nAnd speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen, Ulf is getting a\\nlittle out of hand lately.  His cheap shots are getting more\\nfrequent and more violent.  As everybody in the Meadowlands\\nexcept for the officials could see last night, he rammed the\\nbutt of his stick down one of the Devil\\'s throat.  I\\'ve always\\nsupported the argument \"he does his job by being irritating,\"\\nbut he\\'s starting to push it over the edge IMHO.  Of course,\\nHolik\\'s chop to Barrasso\\'s neck wasn\\'t too sportsmanlike either.\\nIt seems that he was following the \"The only way to beat the\\nPenguins is to injure them\" philosophy.\\n\\nAs my Modern Drama professor pointed out to me the other day,\\nJagr was stoned pretty well Tuesday night, and last night as\\nwell, although the 30 seconds he danced around the Devils end\\nwas pretty exciting.Can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make\\nabsolutely no sense?  (At least in the local Gannett rag that finds its way\\nto my door.)  I must have stared at \"Cleman\" in the Mets\\' box for a\\ngood 30 seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was.  Wouldn\\'t\\nit make more sense to use \"Colemn\"?Here are my predictions (try not to laugh hysterically)\\nSomebody save this so I can laugh when I win my own pool.\\nI don\\'t have prizes, but we all love BRAGGING RIGHTS, so winner takes them.\\n\\nAlso.  If somebody has some sort of scoring system let me know.\\nI was thinking 1 for 1st round victories, 2 for second, 3 for 3rd, 4 for 4th\\nBut we may get alot of ties.  Any ideas?\\n\\n\\n\\n1. BUFFALO\\n2. MONTREAL\\n3. PITTSBURGH\\n4. WASHINGTON\\n5. CHICAGO\\n6. TORONTO\\n7. WINNIPEG\\n8. LOS ANGELES\\n\\n9. MONTREAL\\n10.PITTSBURGH\\n11.CHICAGO\\n12.WINNIPEG\\n\\n13.MONTREAL\\n14.CHICAGO\\n\\n15. MONTREALquoted for future reference...\\n\\n\\nHe believed one of two things: 1) Sabo was more likely than Samuel\\nto get a hit OR 2) that more good would be done in the long run\\nby leaving Sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome.\\n\\nIn fact you don\\'t know what Perez had in mind when he left Sabo in.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, I don\\'t think anyone is claiming that they can predict\\nthe future, or any particular future event.  But we can believe\\nthat certain trends are due to a cause (whether or not we have\\nidentified the cause) and therefore will continue.\\n\\n\\nI think seeing insults in other people\\'s opinions is kind of silly.\\nAfter all, Mark didn\\'t call you a total idiot, or call your work\\nstupid, he simply stated that it didn\\'t change his opinion on the \\nsubject.\\n\\n\\nIf player A hits better on Tuesdays and always has, and Mark believes\\nthat it might be an indication that he will hit on Tuesday better next\\nseason as well, would you respond the same way?  At some point you\\nmight admit that all variable might not be known to you (who knows\\nwhat this guy does every Monday night?  Maybe he sees his sports\\nshrink on Tuesday mornings, or has his Vitamin B shots Monday nights?)\\n\\nBut this is something that\\'s true of one guy only.  It doesn\\'t\\nmean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire\\nleague by days of the week, nor that there should be.  But it doesn\\'t\\nmean we can\\'t make predictions based on that for that particular\\nplayer.\\n\\n\\nI only see a prediction for one player here.  I don\\'t see anything\\nabout ALL batters.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s exactly what Mark is trying to do though.  Find hitters\\nthat have these correlation and ask whether we can make predictions\\nfor these hitters based on their past performance.\\n\\n\\nHuh?  What does gambler\\'s fallacy have to do with anything?\\nWhether you can know the reason for correlation or not, you can\\'t\\ndeny that it has existent, you can only make an argument that\\nyou don\\'t think it is likely to continue to exist because you\\ncan\\'t see a reason for it to exist.\\n\\n\\nSomeone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate.\\nThe argument along the lines of star player with L/R splits will\\nalways see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game\\n(i.e. opposing manager will always bring in a AH pitcher to\\nface him, where his manager will not pull him for a PH)\\n\\n\\nWhat about you?  If the shoe fits, will you wear it with an open mind?\\n\\nWell, the \"jettison for youth fast\" strategy was his. Also in hindsight, it\\ndidn\\'t work all that well, but I think it was more because it left the\\nSharks on a tightrope without a net, not that it was inherently flawed. It\\nwas the injuries that caused us to fall.\\n\\n\\nFrom all indications, it wasn\\'t the \"major\" factor, but the \"last straw\".\\nThere were personality conflicts among Shark management, and disagreements\\nover how personnel were going to be handled (not just who was being traded\\nvs. kept, but who was being sent to KC. What Ferriera did, if rumors are\\nright, was not always what the folks behind the bench wanted or needed).\\n\\n\\nI think if they\\'d kept Ferriera, they would have lost some of their other\\nmanagement staff. Depending on which sources you trust, we might have lost\\nGrillo AND Lombardi AND Murdoch over the summer. Frankly, I want to keep\\nthose three. (we may well ahve also lost Kingston, which, of course, is now\\na moot point). \\n\\nThe Sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly\\nconsensual and cooperative. Ferriera wanted to run things his way. There\\nwere conflicts. Ferriera lost. That says nothing about his skills or\\naccomplishments -- at that level, a lot is personality and politics. \\n\\nI think he did some good things for the Sharks, but that he never fit in as\\na \"Shark person\".

Ok, it seems that everyone else in canada was treated to the \\nREAL ABC telecast while only the people on ROGERS TV in Surrey BC \\nwere treated to two channels with Don \"I stink as a Commentator\" Whitman\\ndoing the play-by-play.Kevin Mitchell\\'s sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated \\npitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over \\nNew York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started \\nwith a solid single to right, moved to second on \"Bob\" Kelly\\'s infield sneaker\\ndown the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson\\'s well-placed bunt--a \\nrare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.\\n\\nCincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only \\ngiven up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double\\nby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after\\nJoe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who \\nargued plate umpire Kellogg\\'s inside strike by \"drawing the line\" (really, he\\nshould know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting\\ntossed.\\n\\nThe Mets\\' fifth started with a Howard Johnson\\'s first-pitch homer.  Pugh must \\nhave been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent\\'s\\nsingle, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell\\nand turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley\\'s grounder to the drawn-in Branson\\nfailed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:\\n\\nSaberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield\\nto discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:\\nThompson was hung out to dry after Pugh\\'s first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.\\n(Isn\\'t the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)\\n\\nThe Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin\\'s\\nground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back\\nsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long\\nfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but\\nthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was\\nhung out to dry killing the Reds rally.\\n\\nRob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner\\non second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game\\nin late August last year when Bonilla\\'s three-run dinger slapped a loss on\\nDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci\\'s season.  Bonilla ended\\nup walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a \\nweek, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went\\nto Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings\\nwork, striking out three.

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \\n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind\\'Amour worked\\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes\\' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom\\'s far post, 1-0 Canada.\\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\\n that hit Ranford\\'s post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can\\'t cover the puck in \\n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom\\'s stick side, close\\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\\n then and couldn\\'t produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind\\'Amour scoring on a\\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\\n in the dressing room.\\n\\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\\n\\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden\\'s best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\\n well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because\\n of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman\\'s mistake\\n on the 1-3 goal.\\n\\n Lines information follows further below.\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)\\n\\n 1st:\\n 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47\\n 3rd:\\n\\n Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min\\n Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia\\n Attendance: 3,500\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n Group B results:\\n\\n CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)\\n\\n 1st:\\n 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51\\n      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26\\n      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10\\n 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28\\n      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07\\n\\n Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty\\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\\n Attendance: 10,200\\n\\n The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd\\n showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.\\n\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)\\n\\n 1st:\\n 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00\\n 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26\\n\\n Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min\\n Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia\\n Attendance: 2,800\\n\\n I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn\\'t see the\\n whole game).

It was the timing.\\nSeventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th.  The Expos almost\\ncame back though...\\n2) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980.  So close, yet, so\\nfar.\\nand\\n3) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of\\nyears ago.  It went off the technical ring in the Big O.  It almost left\\nthe stadium!  That was hit HARD!!!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCorelMARK! \\n\\nAgreed here...I\\'ll never forget Dan Kelly calling the play-by-play in the \\'87\\nCanada Cup.  He was masterful!\\n\\nAnd Danny Gallivan will _never_ be replaced; even now when I watch HNIC I\\nremember his voice...when I see an Al MacInnis or Al Iafrate (hey, what\\'s with\\nthese guys named Al who can shoot??) shot from the point I still think\\n\"blistering blast\"...THN had a tribute to Gallivan in the issue following his\\ndeath; in the story they included a quote from one of the games he did.  It\\nwent: \\n\\n\"It appears Risebrough has pugnaciously construed that check,\" he said, \"and \\nwill undoubtedly make a visitation to the box of punition.\"\\n\\nClassic, vintage Gallivan!  He\\'s sorely missed.  So here\\'s to two of the best\\nthere was and best that ever will be.\\n\\n\\nWhoa there!  Lighten up, Andrew!  When I was referring to \"you dorks at\\nthe Western Business School\", I was specifically referring to those\\nassholes writing obnoxious comments insulting the state and people of\\nMinnesota for no apparent reason.  Being Canadian, and one who has\\nfriends who attended UWO, I personally don\\'t want to be associated with\\nthe idiots who wrote those messages.  One more thing, Andrew...until\\nthis season, the Leafs have sucked pretty badly over the last umpteen\\nyears (have they won the Cup during our lifetime?)...so the North Stars\\nhaven\\'t been the only \"shit\" team in the Norris.\\nWe cannot isolate completely, Roger, but we can make a pretty good\\nestimate. I won\\'t claim to split hairs and say that we can really\\nmeasure who was better, Robby Alomar or Carlos Baerga, last year; the\\ndifference is too close to call. But Larkin and Lee? Clemens and\\nMorris? The differences are too great there.\\n\\nIn your measure of the game, why should a team that has just won it\\nall ever replace a single player? Since they are now clearly \"best\",\\nhow can they do better? Yet every team can always find someplace where\\nthey beleive they can improve the team; they can always find a player\\na little better than one they already have. (BTW, by my definitions,\\nthe \"best\" player is the one who does the most things to help his team\\nwin. I will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the\\nteam, by having aptitudes one team needs more than others.)\\n\\nBaseball is a team game, but it is made of individual talents. It is\\nabsurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success\\nor failure of his teammates, whom he did not choose (at least in most\\ncases.) Morris won last year because he played on a team with Joe\\nCarter, Robby Alomar, Tom Henke, Juan Guzman, John Olerud, et al.\\nClemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as\\nHerm Winninham, Luis Rivera, and Jeff Reardon. To define the quality\\nof the team as a sum of its components (as I do, albeit imperfectly)\\nis a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the\\nmean quality of the team (as my reading of your arguments suggests you\\ndo)1st round: \\n----------\\n\\nPITT vs NYI:  PITT in 4. \\n\\nIt looks like a safe bet.

It probably depends on your cable company.\\n\\nI started off switching between the CBC and ABC broadcasts, but finally\\nsettled on ABC.  I can\\'t stand Don Whitman, and Al Michaels was doing a\\ndecent job.

It\\'s kind of \\na sour thing; she disapproved of the job that Sewell et al had done.\\nI can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant\\nsurprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but\\nhe\\'s clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he\\nwere more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away\\nthat huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest\\ndisappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he\\'s\\nonly a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though\\nnot through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided \\nto threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the\\naward goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be\\nMVP, but I\\'d prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the\\nleague\\'s premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the \\nrest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we\\'ll let in fewer\\ngoals than Hartford. Honorable mentions to Majestic Marty and Warren Rychel.\\nJon\\n\\nand guess which game ESPN is showing in my area on Thursday - yep,\\nPens-Devils.  There are so many other interesting series, who cares\\nabout Mario???\\n\\nWell, I agree that if you\\'re going to stand in front of the net,\\nthat you should expect to get hit and hacked at. In general, you\\nshould expect to finish the game with some bruises. However,\\nthere is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain\\nand discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another\\nplayer. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That\\ntwo hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of\\nrespect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He\\ndid not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the\\nslot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he\\nslashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a\\nLeaf supporter (just a supporter, I\\'m not a Leaf fan really), I\\nwas very disappointed.\\n\\nYou\\'re right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least\\nin his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and\\nfor that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that\\'s\\nwhy their names always comes up as examples when we talk about\\nthese issues).

The Babe appears to have made then what today\\'s average to above\\naverage players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and \\naverage inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t \\nthink I\\'m off by much.\\n\\nChop Chop\\n\\nMichael Mule\\' \\n\\n\\n\\nThis brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned\\nthat the NHL could expand in Europe.\\n\\nWould most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing\\nto play for a team in Europe?\\n\\nI do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily\\ninterested in expanding their cultural experience to that level.\\n(I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)\\n\\nWhen one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes\\nme wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these:\\n\\n- Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons)\\n- Nicholls ... in Edmonton.\\n- R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only.\\n- C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.\\n\\nI know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:\\n\\n- Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french\\n  fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One\\n  players\\' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could\\n  not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.\\n\\nAnybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved\\nto London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league\\n(2 years ago?)\\n\\nI wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe.\\n\\nMyself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be \\nthe best way to do it? Has anyone heard anything about Mel Hall this season?  I\\'d heard he wasn\\'t\\nwith the Yankees any more.  What happened to him?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDoug DolvenWell, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. \\nThe Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles\\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\\n\\n\\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \\nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \\nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \\nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \\na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \\ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \\nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \\nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it\\'s because the Isles don\\'t shoot \\ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\\n\\n\\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \\nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he\\'s a\\ndefenseman.  He\\'s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \\nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?  Not\\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\\nreally trying to play the game.  I\\'ll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \\ngood fight once in a while, but only when it\\'s \"called for\".  You know, when a\\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\"\\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \\nI\\'m sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\\nreferee doesn\\'t call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \\nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don\\'t deserve to win in the first place.\\n\\nJust My Honest Opinion,\\n\\n\\nSandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases.  What competition did \\nAlomar have?  Sandberg came in a year after Ripken, and the same year as Boggs,\\nGwynn, and the other magicians.  So less attention was given to Sandberg. \\nAlomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre.  Besides the \\nnumbers don\\'t count.  National league pitchers are much better pitchers. \\n\\nLarry                          on someone elses account \\n--I know there\\'s been a lot of talk about Jack Morris\\' horrible start,\\nbut what about Dennis Martinez.  Last I checked he\\'s 0-3 with 6+ ERA.\\nIs the ageless wonder finally showing his age?  Does he usually start\\noff the season so slowly?  I know he plans to start tonight.

heart of our disagreement. To \\nrebut my opinion, you have made an analogy with a game of chance.\\nYour hypothesis assumes that the Lotto players have no impact on\\nthe selection of the numbers, and hence their ability to win.\\n\\nWell, that\\'s certainly true in Lotto.  But it has absolutely\\nNOTHING to do with the sport of baseball.  When you start down\\nthe wrong path, you finish down the wrong path.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI repeat.  I do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch\\nhitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting\\nperformance.\\n\\nI do, however, think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance\\nmay, for some players, indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed\\nwill provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance.\\nAnd I think Chris Sabo is such a player.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\nGolly, I love stupid people. :-)\\nListen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,\\nthere exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends\\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \\nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\\nwin.  So, let\\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That\\'s amazing.  So,\\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\\nthat\\'s what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\\ntiebreaker and therefore have the \"better\" record, even though both teams\\nhad the same number of points.  If you didn\\'t understand this post, Rex,\\nmaybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.\\n:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)\\n\\n--\\n    Keith Keller\\t\\t\\t\\tLET\\'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLET\\'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\\n\\tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\\t\\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!I\\'d have to say the most impressive HRs I\\'ve ever see came from Dave Kingman\\nand his infamous moon-raker drives...\\nThis is the fifth request to find out about a Cardinals mailing list.\\nIt looks like one does not exist.

Roger Clemson pitch not so dominate.  He walked at least 6 man in\\n} first 6 inns.  But Valetin and Greenwell hit homeruns and Red Sox prevail.\\n\\nClemens struggled with his control, but was also the \"beneficiary\"\\nof some pretty shoddy umpiring. but to be fair, most of the walks were\\nearly in the game, and he adjusted. he was also helped by (dare i say\\nit?) some pretty good defense by the Sox, including Rivera playing\\nat second, not his normal position.\\n\\nactually, Clemens is pretty lucky that he got the win, considering the Sox\\nalmost gave up the lead in the bottom of the 7th on Mo\\'s error catching\\na throw-over.\\n\\n} I think that game is must win for Red Sox in Seattle, considering Darwin will\\n} faced Seattle ace Randy Johnson tonight.\\n\\nmust win? in April?\\nthey\\'ve already won 4 more games so far than anyone thought they would at this \\npoint of the season... i hope people aren\\'t getting too caught up\\nin this streak; it\\'s been fun, but teams have 11-3 streaks all the time,\\nand it is only when they are at the start of the season that they get\\nso much attention.\\nBryan Murray has done very little as GM...Yzerman, Fedorov, Cheveldae,\\nChaisson, the whole Russian strategy was a product of the previous\\nGM...Murray has made a couple of decent trades...that\\'s about it...\\nthat would hardly rank him as the best GM.\\n\\nWasn\\'t Primeau, Murray\\'s first decision as GM...To Mr. Millitello -\\n\\n\\tListen, Sammy, can you explain why Buck pitched you in relief\\nyesterday?

Next week, there\\nwill be far fewer ABC affiliates with hockey.\\n\\nSomeone in this thread said that he wouldn\\'t watch the games even if\\nthey were on TV, and this is a r.s.h. regular contributor!\\n\\nXenophobes north of border needn\\'t fear the US-Americanization of \"our\"\\ngame, because US-Americans will never figure out how to market hockey\\nhere. Support your team; support your game. \\n\\nThe worst thing is that this is exactly what I did last year.  I had the Rangers\\non MSG, and the two different games on SCNY and SCA on at the same time.  Yes,\\nI\\'d rather have SC cover it, just for the amount of coverage.\\n\\n \\n\\nI think Thorne earns his money.  The best part is that he is the same way when \\nhe is earning his $$ from SportsChannel as the Devils announcer (i.e.,\\nunbiased).  He goes orgasmic for goals, despite which team scores, and even more \\nexcited (if possible) for great saves.  He did a good job of explaining certain \\nthings to non-hockey types without offending those of us who follow the sport\\n(unlike NBC\\'s clowns for the ASG).\\n\\n-JPC\\n\\n(Ob. Playoff-time flame-bait)\\n\\n      Don\\'t any of you Pittsburgh fans tell me how Mike Lang(e) is better. \\n      Maybe if he were a little spontaneous, rather than reading rehearsed\\n      lines of B.S having nothing to do with hockey he would be better.\\n\\n-- \\nThe only way to change ESPN\\'s thinking, if it is even possible, is to complain\\nto them directly.  Anyone know there telephone # in Bristol, Ct?  \\n\\nI do find it hard to believe that ESPN doesn\\'t think viewers will simply\\nchange the channel from a boring game....I know I did.  And then, when\\nthey didn\\'t show the NYI-Wash overtime(s), I was livid!  If I wanted\\nto watch baseball, I could have turned on the Phillies-Padres extra\\ninning game....instead, I went to bed angry......I boycotted ESPN\\'s\\nmorning Sportscenter today, I was still so incensed.\\n\\nMy wife says I shouldn\\'t go to bed angry, but last nite.........GRRRRRRR!\\n\\n \\n\\nMost of the points you made about Lopez v. Berryhill/Olson have been\\nmade by others, and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming of\\nFrank Thomas, I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of\\nhis supporters.\\n\\n\\nSee?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopez\\nto one of the best players in the game.  I\\'m really looking forward\\nto seeing this can\\'t-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember\\nbeing an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was\\nonly 21 or 22 (can\\'t remember).  But who did the Sox have at first?\\nCalderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was\\nthere.  Sure, I say go for it.\\n\\nI am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas\\nwas after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/\\nBerryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.\\n\\nBTW, I don\\'t think Thomas was hurt by those three months.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, if we can\\'t compare our guy to one of the best in the game,\\nlet\\'s compare our decision to one of the most \"Boneshead\", right?\\n\\nCal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and a\\nlonger minor league career.  Frankly, I don\\'t know why he didn\\'t\\nmake the club in 1992.  Bones is a year younger with a lousy prior\\nhistory, and just watching him makes me think that I missed a \\ncareer as a big-league pitcher.  No one -  I repeat NO ONE  -\\nlaughed louder than I did at the Sheffield trade.  (Though I guess\\nMieske has a future.)\\n\\n(I take it back. McIlvaine may have laughed louder.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\naw, gee, shucks.  thanks guy.  except I missed the part where SDCN\\'s\\nadmit they\\'re wrong.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\nAgain I assume this is not just flame bait by Roger, but actually a\\ntruly held opinion.  \\n\\n\\nThanks.  For speaking for all those who didn\\'t feel it was important\\nenough to say something themselves.  \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t say that the letter clearly implies representation of the\\nviews of a group that you belong to.  It represents a subset (that you\\ndon\\'t belong to) of a larger group (which you do, if only because this\\nisn\\'t a moderated group).\\n\\nLook, there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint.  Three\\nthat come to mind are as follows:\\n\\n1) Say it subtly.  Result: it may not be clear.\\n2) Say it directly yet politely.  Result: probably it will spark some \\n   interesting conversation.\\n3) Say it directly and obnoxiously.  Result: validity goes right out\\n   the window.\\n\\n\\nYou realize that anything you say can, and most certainly will, be\\nused against you.\\nJust curious if anyone has started to standout early in the season in the\\nBB DDD this year. I expect the Phillies staff, while getting the wins,\\nwould have to rank up there. Luis Gonzalez and Derrick May are among\\nthe early league leaders, and all 6 of their bombs have come at the\\nPhils\\' expense. Neither of them have exactly been know for their tater\\nprowess in the past. \\n\\nHow have the Rockies been early? I know Mile High has produced a ton of \\nruns, but is it the launching pad everyone expected yet? \\n\\nA concerned fan of the BB DDD,\\n\\n\\n\\nThe top 11 teams of this tournament will play in the Olympics next year.\\nThe last team of this tournament, top two of pool B (Great Britain and \\nPoland) and the winner of pool C (Latvia) will play for the last Olympic \\nspot next fall.\\n  However, if next year\\'s hosts Norway were to finish 12th (which would be \\nno surprise), then it\\'s the 11th team of pool A that will have to play in \\nthe qualification tournament.

Thanks, Roger.. This made my evening :-)Deion Sanders hit a home run in his only AB today.  Nixon was 1 for 4.  Infield\\nsingle.  Deion\\'s batting over .400 Nixon: around .200.   Whom would YOU start?\\nWise up, Bobby. \\n\\n\\nSee y\\'all at the ballyard\\nGo Braves\\nChop Chop\\n\\nMichael Mule\\'\\nWas going over some videos last night.....\\n\\nStudying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very\\ninteresting.  And enlightening.\\n\\nHere\\'s my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep \\'92, and Jose Canseco,\\ncirca June 1986.\\n\\n1.  He\\'s bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\\n    not gain more bulk.\\n\\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I\\'d say he\\'s\\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that\\'s a HUGE amount of speed.\\n\\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\\n    Canseco can\\'t.  Also, note that Canseco doesn\\'t always close his\\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\\n    they\\'re fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it\\'s hard\\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\\n\\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\\n\\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\\nso that I\\'d never have to work again, I\\'d restructure my entire swing.\\n\\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\\nthe bathead more freely.\\n\\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\\n\\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\\nthe park.\\n\\nIf Canseco\\'s open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\\nproblems, he\\'ll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\\nstill hit 600+ HR.\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'d like to add that I think Canadian hockey fans like Don because his kind of hockey (the hockey he promotes in his TV appearances) is the kind that they think used to get played in the old 6 team NHL. So there\\'s a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren\\'t afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European in\\n\\n\\n\\nfluence on the game has diminished it in some people\\'s eyes.\\n\\nPersonally, I\\'d like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced \"European\" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot. I have to say that I missed him when I was living in the States, though. He is entertaining, even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he\\'s on.\\n-- \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n         \\nI stand by all the misstatements that I\\'ve made.\\n\\t\\t-- Vice President Dan Quayle to Sam Donaldson, 8/17/89\\nFunny you should mention this; one time on HNIC Don Cherry pointed out\\nVanbiesbrouck\\'s mask.  He _hated_ it.  I think he said something to the effect\\nof:\\n\"You see?  He was great last year; now he goes out and gets that dopey mask \\nand he can\\'t stop a beachball!\"\\n\\nYou may or may not take Cherry seriously at all, but I cracked up when I heard\\nit.Tim Belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as Cincinnati won \\ntheir second straight 5-0.  Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and \\noften by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some\\nrecently rare power with their bats.\\n\\nBelcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the\\ngame progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those\\nwere few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while\\nstriking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was working\\nfor him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on \\nbreaking balls.\\n\\nTomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch\\ndouble to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and \\nBarry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys\\n(Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact\\nthey all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal\\nand a Tomlin wild pitch.\\n\\nIn fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky\\nstart-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only\\n2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was\\npoorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would \\nlater score on Reggie Sanders\\' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead \\nafter 4.\\n\\nThe fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second\\ndouble of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the \\nleft field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run on\\nTom Prince\\'s two-base passed ball.  \\n\\nThe Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the\\nfifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second \\nbeing of the \"bunt\" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a \\nfoul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith \"K\\'d\" to end any Pittsburgh hope.\\n\\nPittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor,\\nMoeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings\\nwork.\\n\\nBarry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played \\nbruised his right thumb.  He was taken to the hospital for \"precautionary\\nX-rays\".  Let\\'s hope he\\'s OK.\\n\\nCincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with the\\ntwo wins they may be looking at  moving out of the cellar!\\nPittsburgh is now 7-6.\\n\\n*********REDS FANS***************************\\nIf you would like to receive this report on a \\nsemi-daily basis (as often as I write it), \\nsend me your e-mail address and I\\'ll put you \\non the list.

Everyone comes up with Clark, Williams, Thompson.  These guys\\nwere all up in 1987.  That\\'s ancient history.  So in the last 6 years,\\nnoone, right?  Beck doesn\\'t count.  I said 2 solid years.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s see what he does w/o the help of a pitchout every other pitch.\\nAs I remember, even Bob Brenly had a good throwout percentage under\\nRoger Craig, who loved to sacrifice the count for runners being thrown\\nout.  Of course, he suffered from 3 ball 1 strike homers a lot too.\\nI am not a big fan of Manwaring.\\n\\nThe injury is to his fielding hand, which is good.  Unfortunately, he may\\nhave some ligament damage and may require surgery, which would lay him up\\nfor a while.\\n\\n\\nApparently just a strain of some sort.  He hasn\\'t been put on the DL, so\\nit\\'s probably just day-to-day.\\n\\n\\nWell, it seems that the Habs have been much talked-about of late, so here\\'s my\\n$0.02.  These guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the\\ndamn net!!!  Watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay. \\nDamphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the\\npoint, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE\\'S THE SHOT??!\\nAnswer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands\\nin front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc.  Too bad \\nDemers won\\'t put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often.  Dammit,\\neven Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needs\\na power forward with some talent, IMO.\\n\\nThen watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say\\nwhat you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see. \\nAnd Montreal\\'s defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. \\nLast night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal came\\non the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I\\'ve seen in a long time, and he\\ndidn\\'t have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  The second goal came on a\\ndeflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  The\\nthird goal was EN.\\n\\nNo wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd have Jesse Jackson picket the stadium?\\n\\n\\nFrom his Topps \"rookie\" year (as coach) card (74-75):\\n\"For the past couple of seasons, Don has been the highly-successful\\n coach of the Rochester Americans of the AHL, but he is getting his\\n first shot at an NHL job with the Bruins.  Named Coach of the Year\\n in the AHL the last two years, and he aims to make the Bruins a\\n rough team again, as they were a couple of years back.  Although\\n he played 16 seasons of professional hockey, Don never played a\\n regular-season NHL game.  He did appear in one playoff game for\\n Boston in 1956-57.  Don\\'s brother, Dick, played two seasons in the\\n NHL with Boston and Philadelphia.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI think the three-headed GM\\'s guiding principle was to keep veterans\\nin favor of youngsters only if they offered a \"significant\" advantage.\\nAt the end of last season, the contracts of several veterans with somewhat\\nmaginal contributions (Fenton, Bozek, Anderson, and a couple others I\\ncan\\'t remember) were bought out. The idea was that youngsters could\\nplay almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these\\nolder guys did not. \\nAnd they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he\\nwasn\\'t good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic\\nin thinking they could make up for his contributions.\\nAn example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis\\nbut not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent\\ncontributor worth keeping around.\\n\\nThe youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who\\nmight still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around. But\\nyou have to find the right balance.\\n\\nAbout 25 is correct for Numminen and Lumme.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, Kurri\\'s points are too low. 27 for Kurri and 28 for Sel{nne.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s true. Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL. North-ame-\\nricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average\\neuropean player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better \\nskater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL\\nare mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league\\ngame is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn\\'t get so many \\nbreakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in\\nNHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne\\'s speed accentuates because\\nof clumsy defensemen.\\n\\nI have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars\\naren\\'t as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans\\nare in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the\\nclass of his own). I was thinking about who on each of the teams were the MVPs, biggest\\nsurprises, and biggest disappointments this year. Now, these are just\\nmy observations and are admittedly lacking because I have not had an\\nopportunity to see all the teams the same amount. Anyway....\\n  \\nMVP = most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and\\n      in terms of leadership (\"can\\'t win without him\")\\n  \\nBiggest surprise = the player who rose above expectation -- the player\\n      that may have raised the level of his game to a new height, even\\n      if that new level doesn\\'t necessarily warrant an allstar berth\\n      (includes those players who at the outset of the season, may not\\n      even have been in the team\\'s plans).\\n   \\nBiggest disappointment = the player from whom we expected more (e.g., I\\n      picked Denis Savard in Montreal because with the new emphasis on\\n      offence brought by Demers, shouldn\\'t Savard have done better?)\\n   \\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  \\n                        Team           Biggest       Biggest\\nTeam:                   MVP:          Surprise:    Disappointment:\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nBoston Bruins           Oates          D.Sweeney     Wesley\\nBuffalo Sabres          Lafontaine     Mogilny       Audette (jinx?)\\nCalgary Flames          Roberts        Reichel       Petit\\nChicago Blackhawks      Roenick        Ruuttu        Goulet\\nDetroit Red Wings       Yzerman        Chaisson      Kozlov\\nEdmonton Oilers         Manson         Buchberger    Mellanby\\nHartford Whalers        Sanderson      Cassells      Corriveau\\nLos Angeles Kings       Robitaille     Donnelly      Hrudey\\nMinnesota North Stars   Modano      Tinordi(not expected back)  Broten\\nMontreal Canadiens      Muller         Lebeau        Savard\\nNew Jersey Devils       Stevens        Semak         MacLean\\nNew York Islanders      Turgeon        King(finally) Marois\\nNew York Rangers        Messier        Kovalev       Bourque\\nOttawa Senators         MacIver        Baker         Jelinek\\nPhiladelphia Flyers     Lindros/Recchi Fedyk/Galley  Eklund\\nPittsburgh Penguins     Lemieux        Tocchet(even for him)  Jagr\\nQuebec Nordiques        Sakic/Ricci    Kovalenko     Pearson\\nSan Jose Sharks         Kisio          Gaudreau      Maley\\nSt Louis Blues          Shanahan       C.Joseph      Ron Sutter\\nTampa Bay Lightening    Bradley        Bradley       Creighton/Kasper\\nToronto Maple Leafs     Gilmour        Potvin        Ellett/Anderson\\nVancouver Canucks       Bure           Nedved(finally)    Momesso\\nWashington Capitals     Hatcher        Bondra/Cote   Elynuik\\nWinnipeg Jets           Selanne        Selanne       Druce\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  \\nAs I mentioned up top, these are my *impressions* from where I sit.

(Don also claims that\\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\\nresulting in a goal.\\n\\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\\nthe Leaf players \"Don\\'t let them score on you\".\\n\\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\\ninstant replay.\\n\\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team\\'s playoff checks for his\\nplay.\\n\\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\\nthat he can\\'t play the way he should, because of the league\\'s\\nnew rules. \"This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\\nall hack and slash.\" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\\nproblems.\\n\\nDon\\'s opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\\nin which Murray makes the following statements: \"Players don\\'t fight\\nbecause they\\'re afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\\nwouldn\\'t be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.\"\\n\\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to \"smarten up\" with\\nfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used\\nto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,\\nsomeone gets cut every period.\\n\\nRating\\n------\\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don\\'s opinion is supported\\nby Murray.I am interested in uncovering statistics on Boston Red Sox players from\\nMarch 1992 - present.  I want to look at changes in batting average, hits,\\nmulti-hit games, runs, stolen bases, and on base % during\\nevery game.  Where can\\nI find this information?  Do any sports magazines log this info or do I\\nhave to go directly to the ball club?\\nThanks for the info.  Kip\\nHe  \\ndimmagio\\'s.\\n\\nHenderson\\'s stat\\'s are probably closer to DiMaggio\\'s than you\\nthink.\\nI need a little help from a Texas Rangers expert.\\n\\nI was at Yankee Stadium Sunday (12-2 Texas rout) with my kids.  We\\nwandered out to the outfield during Rangers batting practice and\\nI caught a ball tossed into the stands (actually wrestled some guy\\na bit, I might add) by #62 on the Rangers.  Who is he?  Looked like\\na bullpen assistant type, youngish I think.  He was not in the\\nroster listed in the Yankee scorecard.  Any ideas?\\n\\nPlease e-mail as I haven\\'t been reading r.s.b regularly.\\n\\nThanks.\\n- BobWhat about including points?  Probably no goals (at least against\\nopponents) but there have been several assists given.\\nRogers is the \"one-batter lefty\" in the bullpen.  Dusty has also said he\\ntrusts Rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where Beck is\\nunavailable, so you might see a couple of saves for Kevin.  Then again, if\\nany of the regular rotation falters, Rogers is a possible candidate to\\nstart, though this would appear less likely now that Dave Burba did well\\nin an emergency start.\\nThis talk about the Phillies winning the NL East is scary.  VERY\\nscary!  Don\\'t get me wrong, Im a Phillies fan but as late as last\\nyear they looked helpless.  The funny thing was they did have a lot\\nof injuries in \\'92 spring training that basically killed their\\nchances.  Of course, don\\'t forget the Dykstra wrist injury in the\\nfirst or second game?  \\n\\n\\nBut why McGwire, and not Carter?  I can see some justification for Bonds or\\nThomas, because they tend to have higher batting averages, but the major\\ndifference I see between McGwire and Carter is that Carter doesn\\'t draw\\nwalks.  Why aren\\'t pitchers afraid to throw strikes to Carter?\\n2) Hitting....Hawks tried to outmuscle Blues but could not do it.\\nInstead, Blues matched Hawks hit for hit and crunched the shit out of\\nthem in game #4.....Scud line, Shanahan, Butcher, and Zombo particularly\\ntook turns bashing favorite targets like Chelios.\\n\\n3) Skating.....when the Hawks tried to outskate Blues, they could not do\\nthat either.  Nelson Emerson finally showed up and skated circles around\\nflat footed Chicago defense.....Hedican, Felsner, Ron Wilson and others\\nalso proved that with old cement skaters like Goulet and Keith Brown,\\nBlues could lap Chicago in a 400 M relay race.\\n\\n\\n     I agree with #2 but you are wrong about #3.  In fact, the only\\n     point where the Hawks in any way matched the Blues was when\\n     they quit trying to outmuscle and instead tried to outskate\\n     the Blues.  They scored and took the lead.  Too bad it was\\n     Game 4 and they then took some stupid penalties.  When the\\n     Hawks skated, they outskated the Blues and took control.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Alomar fans left RBI fans and Runs off this list because they are dependant\\non the team. (To a large extent). If Frank Thomas hit first, he\\'d lose a LOT\\nof RBI\\'s; and anyways how many 2nd place hitters have you known to drive\\nin 100 runs? Doesn\\'t happen that often.....very unlikely with Devon White\\'s\\n~.300 OBP in front of you...I agree thouroughly!!  Screw the damn contractual agreements!\\nShow the exciting hockey game.  They will lose\\nfans of ESPN (of which I have been one for quite a while) quickly \\nwith decisions like this.\\nJust my $.02\\nI agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result\\nin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%\\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games.  Thus,\\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\\n\\n\\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nThus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K\\'s, BB\\'s,\\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \\npitcher?  They were probably about the same.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs if an aluminum stick being taken to Ulf\\'s head is gonna solve the problem\\nwith violence in the sport of hockey.  How the hell can you say the guy is\\na goon and justify it, with your back-assward mentality?  Saying that hurting\\na player will solve anyone\\'s problems is asinine.  New rules and a new \\nreferee system need to be instituted.  Right now, too many of the real goons\\nget away with too much, because the ref is watching the play (or supposed to be:I\\'ve seen Koharski and Van Hellemond, to name a few, with their heads up their  asses on a few calls) rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the \\nplay.  Even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties, it would be an\\nimprovement.I wonder how many more years it will take Gretz to beat this one? ;-)\\nI dont know about the story but it comes from the fact that in most stadiums, the batter faces northeast and so when\\na pitcher is on the mound, his left arm is to the south, hence the term.Not to mention, Mr. Francis is an incredibly nice person.  Over Christmas\\nbreak, a friend of mine had a little Xmas gathering.  The two of us drove\\nto Ron\\'s house.  While I stayed in the car out of shyness, my friend went\\nto the door and rang the bell.  Ron answered and my friend introduced\\nhimself.  He then proceeded to invite Francis to the party.  Ron declined\\nbecause he \"had to watch his daughter.\"  He then reached out and shook my\\nfriend\\'s hand!

(Source: Bill James\\nHistorical Baseball Abstract.)\\n     And let\\'s not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in\\n1985.

Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4\\nscoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like\\na really good one.

That was the bronze medal game in the \\nSM-liiga which Tichonov\\'s team Porin Assat (the Aces of town Pori:)\\nlost.  Vasili, the son of Victor Tichonov (the famous Soviet coach),\\nsaid that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him to\\ntake the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach where\\never he goes. He definitely won\\'t be coaching Assat anymore (after\\nthree? seasons). I don\\'t know why.\\n\\nVasili is a good coach I believe. Assat was a good team, produced many\\nplayers to our national team. Assat wasn\\'t a skilled team (IMHO) but\\nthey had the fighting spirit. After all, they butchered Jokerit in the\\nplayoffs and gave hard time to TPS, the champs. But Assat wasn\\'t\\nconsistent, only when they were in the right mood they could beat any\\nteam in the SM-liiga.\\n\\nI am not 100% sure about the deal with the Sharks. As I said, he wants\\nto be the head coach. But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate and\\ndecide during the WC. I doubt that he will be the head coach but\\nmaybe they\\'ll do some compromise.Rawley Eastwick\\n\\n\\tWell, if SHIT means going to the Stanley Cup finals a couple years\\nago, I\\'d rather be shit than a leaf fan.\\n\\n\\nmlb.c is archived on the Internet Baseball Archive\\n\\nanoymous ftp to eucalyptus.cc.swarthmore.edu (130.58.67.44)\\nyou must use your full email / username id as a password\\n\\ncd ./baseball/schedules\\n\\nit\\'s filed as mlb-schedule-program.c for clarity\\n\\nschedules pre-generated for east-coast times are there as text files as\\nwell, and a couple of teams\\' TV schedules -- please send me more TV info if\\nyou have it on other teams.\\n\\n- matt\\n\\nMatt Wall * wall@cc.swarthmore.edu * Hey, I gotta job here, OK?Here is yet another prediction for them great playoffs!\\n(you may laugh at your convenience!) :)\\n\\n\\tAdams Division (I hate the NE (name) divisoin!!!)\\n\\nBOS vs BUF   BOS in 5  (the B\\'s are hot lately!)\\n\\nMON vs QUE   MON in 7  (This will be the series to watch in the first round!)\\n\\n\\nBOS vs MON   MON in 7  (this may be a bit biased but I feel the Canadiens will\\n\\t\\t       (smarten up and start playing they played two months ago\\n\\t\\t\\t( i.e. bench Savard !!!)\\n\\tPatrick Division \\n\\nPIT vs NJD   PIT in 6  (It wont be a complete cake walk... there be a few lumps\\n\\t\\t\\t(in the cake batter!)\\n\\nWAS vs NYI   WAS in 6  \\t(This will not be an exciting series..IMO)\\n\\n\\nPITT vs WAS  PIT in 4   (Washington will be tired after the NYI)\\n\\n\\tNorris Division\\n\\nCHI vs StL    CHI in 5   (StL will get a lucky game in)\\n\\nTOR vs DET    TOR in 7   (THis , like MON vs QUE, will be another intense \\n\\t\\t\\t (series to watch!)\\n\\nCHI vs TOR    TOR in 7   (Potvin will be settling in nicely by this point.)\\n\\n\\tSmythe Division\\n\\nVAN vs WIN     VAN in 5  (Teemu is great, but Vancouver better as a team!)\\n\\nCAL vs LAK     CAL in 6  (Gretzky is great, but Calgary has been on fire lately)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t...sorry for the pun... um, no I am not! :)\\n\\nVAN vs CAL     VAN in 6  (This will be a great series! but VAN has proven they\\n\\t\\t\\t (Will not lie down and get beat!)\\n\\n\\tWales Conference finals\\n\\nPittsburgh vs Montreal    \\tMontreal in 6 (Montreal IMHO is the only team\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      (that has a chance against \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPittsburgh.)\\n\\n\\tCampbell Conference finals\\n\\nVancouver vs Toronto\\t\\tToronto in 6  (Potvin will be series MVP)\\n\\n\\n\\tSTANLEY CUP FINALS  \\n\\nToronto Maple Leafs    vs    Montreal Canadiens    \\n\\t(The Classic Stanley Cup Final matchup!!) <---also a dream come true!\\n\\n\\tMontreal wins the Stanley cup in the 7th game 1 - 0 in double overtime.\\nRoy and Potvin are spectacular throughout the series and share series MVP (if \\nthat is possible) Vincent Damphouse nets game winner from a brilliant pass by\\nBrian Bellows!

I think\\nbatting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special\\neffort to get to the game very early in order to see it.  I think the\\ndelaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are\\ninteresting because they\\'re attempts to gain advantage through control\\nof the flow and timing of the game.  Of course, the umpires can, and\\nshould, intervene when these tactics get out of hand.  As Ryan Robbins\\nhas pointed out, there are rules that cover this.\\n\\nOne of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its\\nopen-endedness with regard to time.  You never know if the game is going\\nto zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it\\'s going to\\ngo on until four in the morning.  Likewise, some games are action-packed,\\nand some games are slow and lazy.  That\\'s fine by me.

That \"has great hands\" means nothing.  It seems to me that\\na first-baseman\\'s defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily)\\nfrom his ability to field grounders or catch popups.  How many such\\nchances does he get during a game?  Many fewer than he gets chances\\nto catch throws from 2B,SS,3B and P (I mean the total of these is\\nmuch higher than Grounder/Popup totals).  This implies to me that there\\nis value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line\\nor in the dirt.  \"Good Hands\" are needed for such plays, and thus have\\nvalue.  I don\\'t have any numbers for the relative number of occurences\\nof these plays, but I\\'d guess that the values of these abilities are\\nsimilar.  It\\'s just like: you don\\'t judge catcher\\'s defense primarily\\non how they field bunts and popups. (But not as marked I suppose).\\nI would assume that the words (I saw the picture) indicated that those \\nSEATS will not be available for baseball games.  If you look at the picture \\nof the diamond in the stadium, in relation to the areas marked \"NOT FOR \\nBASEBALL\", those seats just look terrible for watching baseball.

He was IMO, something like the 30th best\\nhitter in the majors.Well, I looked at the scoring plan I had, and have decided to modify it. \\nHere is the new, finalized scoring:\\n\\nPick 1st round winner, way off on games:\\t2\\n\"     \"    \"     \"     pick within one game:\\t3\\n\"     \"    \"     \"     pick exact games:\\t4\\n\\nPick 2nd round winner, way off on games:\\t4\\n\"     \"    \"     \"     pick within one game:\\t5\\n\"     \"    \"     \"     pick exact games:\\t7\\n\\nPick conference champ, way off on games:\\t7\\n\"\\t\"\\t\"      pick within one game:\\t10\\n\"\\t\"\\t\"      pick exact games:\\t13\\n\\nPick Stanley Cup winner, way off on games:\\t13\\n\"\\t\"    \"\\t   \"\\tpick within one game:\\t17\\n\"\\t\"    \"\\t   \"\\tpick exact games:\\t20\\nPick loser in 7, series goes 7:\\t\\t\\t2\\nPick loser in 7, game 7 decided in OT:\\t\\t4\\n\\nThese are now final.

It would be nice to just sell them for $3 each, but then\\nthe people who get the Whalers and Devils (Note, I\\'m not bagging on these teams\\nits just that they don\\'t have alot of good rookie cards in this set) would\\nbe subsidizing the people who want Chicago or Pittsburgh.

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\\n1400 for this year.\\n============================================================\\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\n======================================================\\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\\nSports Network in Canada (but I\\'m not sure about that). I am not\\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\\n=====================================================\\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\\n=====================================================\\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\\n\\nONE OPTION\\t\\t\\t\\tANOTHER OPTION\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nNorthern Division\\t\\t\\tSouthern Division\\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\\t\\t\\tADIRONDACK\\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\\t\\t\\tSPRINGFIELD\\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\\t\\t\\tPROVIDENCE\\nCD ISLANDERS\\t\\t\\t\\tCDI\\nPORTLAND PIRATES\\t\\t\\tHERSHEY\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBINGHAMTON\\nSouthern Division\\t\\t\\tROCHESTER\\nHERSHEY BEARS\\t\\t\\t\\tHAMILTON\\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\\t\\t\\tUTICA\\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\\t\\t\\tAtlantic Division\\nUTICA (?)

If you want the\\nRoger Nielsons of the world to be your coach you don\\'t go out and\\nget a Mark Messier, who is an old dog who can\\'t learn new tricks\\nfrom a known loser, and you don\\'t waste your draft picks on players\\nlike Kovalev.\\n\\nGeraldWell, it really isn\\'t this cut and dry, but as a Jay fan the thing I feared\\nworst has happened. The Yanks sent down Williams G and are going to start\\nWilliams B in CF.\\n  I also believe they kept Wickman and Millitello in their rotation, which is\\nmuch nicer than that Kaminiecki and Mike Witt combo I thought they\\'d throw\\nout their to the slaughterhouse because of their \"experience\". Granted, Witt\\n\"might\" be good, but I think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters\\nup and not given the job to Witt because he was a good pitcher and has\\nexperience.\\n  The Yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards; the\\nJays with the loss of Dave Stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their\\npitching staff.\\n  The Orioles should also be there in the end.....I thought that Walt Weiss was jewish.  I seem to recall this\\nwas mentioned once while he was still at Oakland.\\n\\nAlso, I have my suspicions about Esther Canseco (nee Haddad).\\n\\nAttendance in 1992 was down. By .3%.

Hardly heard Selanne\\'s name all night.\\nCraven also played one of his best games since coming over.  With a\\nfew exceptions, they really didn\\'t let the high-flying Jets do much\\nhigh-flying.

It is anything BUT common.  In the\\n4 or 5 years I have been watching hockey I have NEVER seen this happen EVER.\\n\\nI am not sure what league you have been watching.  :-)\\n\\nAnyone else agree with this?\\n\\n\\nWell, there were 27 outs in a row with no hits or walks in between, but\\nreally, he only retired 26 batters in a row.  The first out of the game\\nwas the front end of a double play.  Still counts as a back-end perfect\\ngame in my book, though. \\n\\nCongrats to Chris Bosio.  Too bad the Brewers couldn\\'t hold on to him.\\nIMO any good player should score on power plays because of the man\\nadvantage.  Very good power play scorers tend to become overrated\\nbecause their point totals are inflated by power play points.\\n+/- tends to expose these overrated players such as Brett Hull,\\nJohn Cullen and Dave Andreychuck.\\n\\nGiven the opportunity to play power play consistently, any player can\\ninflate his totals.[some deletions]\\n\\nWell, we agree on the last part.:-)  One of the basic things you need to \\nhave in a statistic to be able to predict a player\\'s performance on it\\nin the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year.  A \\nplayer\\'s batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.\\nA player\\'s ability to walk or infielder\\'s Defensive Average are correlated\\nbetter.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics\\nwe can have a pretty good handle on how they\\'ll do next year.  Put in \\nsome simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of \\nthe basic problems with something like \"clutch\" batting average - overall\\nbatting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. \\nAdding to the sample size doesn\\'t seem to help much.  As a counterexample to \\nwhat you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\\n\\n               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\\n               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\\n \\nMaldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\\nLemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\\n\\nIf you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\\nsituations, you\\'d bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in \\n1988, Maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while Lemon\\nhit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  Before you accuse me of \\ncompletely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ \"clutch\"\\nat bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple\\nmeasure of clutchness, let\\'s just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use \\n\\'84-\\'87 to predict \\'88 for those 96 players, you\\'d find that 27 of the\\n96 were below league average in that measure both in \\'84-87 and in \\'88,\\n26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were \\nabove in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins,\\nyou\\'d expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  The\\ndifference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment\\nis not statisically significant.\\n\\nBTW, correlating players\\' _overall_ batting average from \\'84-\\'87 with\\n\\'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\\nsomething better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their\\n(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of \\n0.088, significant at no level of any interest.\\n\\n\\nActually, it\\'s technically incorrect to say that we can\\'t predict future\\nclutch performance.  It\\'s more correct to say that we can\\'t predict\\nfuture clutch performance with any skill.\\n\\nHarold\\nLook how long the Maple Leafs and Nordiques used similar logic....  Not that\\nthey fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams, but the Maple Leafs (and a\\ncertain dead man who was in charge) were one of the cheapest teams in the\\nhistory of the sport.  Guess what-- they were immensely popular at the\\ngate.  The Nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the\\nplayoffs so many years in a row.\\n\\n\\nHa!  Such humor!  They have MAJOR fan problems, namely that on occasion some of\\nthem don\\'t make it home from the match!  The soccer fans tend to be fanatical,\\nmuch like the Montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when\\nthey play pathetically.\\n \\n-JPC\\n\\n-- \\nYes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You\\'re talking about averages, when we\\nhave lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our\\ndecisions on.\\n\\nI might as well say \"We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet\\ntall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.\"\\n\\n\\nWhy isn\\'t Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after\\nadjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an\\nabsolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.\\n\\nAs for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the\\nminors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don\\'t\\nbelieve there is), then wouldn\\'t you rather waste Lopez\\'s 22-year old good\\nseason than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent\\nseason?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to\\nuse.\\n\\n\\nThe point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he\\nhadn\\'t done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager\\nto question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him\\ndown \"until he gets warmed up\".\\n\\n\\nMost players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do\\nwith Javy Lopez?\\n\\n\\nSee above.  \\n\\n\\nBut I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most\\nplayers aren\\'t that good, so they probably won\\'t be that good this year\\neither.\\n\\n\\nAnd demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.\\n\\n\\nNot superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we\\'re\\nbeing charitable.\\n\\n\\nUmmm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year\\nin his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a\\nbig question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and\\nhas rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who\\'s in).  Blauser is a very valuable\\nbat... for a shortstop.\\n\\n\\n\\nWanna bet?  The difference between Lopez\\'s bat and Olson/Berryhill could be\\n20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player\\nwith experience and a player who can play, I\\'ll take the latter every time.\\n\\n\\nJust like Keith Mitchell did?\\n\\n\\nThat was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they\\nreally don\\'t understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,\\nor some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more\\nflattering to the organization.\\n\\n\\n[Well-argued but inflammatory reply deleted.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, my question still hasn\\'t been answered: if Spanky was bad enough to\\nrelease this year, why did he get so much playing time last year?  Yes, I know\\nhe was part of a platoon, and that\\'s why he got more playing time than\\nSlaught, but that doesn\\'t answer the question.  If Slaught was so obviously\\nbetter this year, wasn\\'t this also obvious last year, and shouldn\\'t he\\nhave been taking away some of Spanky\\'s playing time against righties?\\n\\tWhat about his rectum?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAm I the only person who thinks the Reds sleeveless uniforms are\\nugly?

(although the Internet comes close.)The O\\'s just lost to the Rangers a few minutes ago I was not too happy about\\nthe pitching of Rick Sutcliffe (6 runs in 6 innings, 5 in the 3?) This puts\\nme in remembering the 1990 O\\'s season. After \\'89 we didn\\'t do much over\\nwinter and we wound up in 5th. Now I know that Mussina, McDonald, and Rhodes\\nare better pitching prospects than Ballard and Milacki but are any other\\nOriole fans scared out there?\\n\\nAdmiral Steve C. LiuHell, the Orioles\\' Opening Day game could easily be the largest in history\\nif we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. But unfortunely the Yards (a\\ndefinitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots.\\nTicket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost\\ngone for every game this year. It\\'s a extremely likelyhood that the O\\'s\\ncould sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for\\nmost of the year like \\'89). \\n\\tOn another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be\\nforced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an\\nowner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.\\n\\tFernando has made the O\\'s as the fifth starter. The O\\'s pitching\\nstaff looks pretty good.

I think I\\'d like to see Meehan gone...\\nJust to add to this vein, consider that range of a first baseman is not\\nthe only important thing.  He is IMO the best fielder of bad throws from\\nthe other infielders.  I have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt, catch\\nballs off a large bounce, take down balls over his head, wide, etc. ad\\ninfinitum.  *And* he gets the out, much of the time.  Some of the things\\nhe does to save his infielders of errors are amazing.  You have to give\\nMattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot\\nnear the bag (yes, I am sure he gets a few calls because he is Mattingly :-)\\nKC(?) news was doing a report on that.  They said that McRae is\\nreally a batting coach and not a manager.  But for some reason\\nhe took the job.  Whatever the reason, the Royals need a new\\nmanager now...while it is too late.\\nTickets are very hard to get, even at the box office at Camden Yards.\\nIf you really want to see a game here (I go to school in Baltimore),\\nprice should not be an issue.

They didn\\'t wait for him to clear\\nwaivers as three other clubs were also very interested in him.

But that is\\nonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with\\ninjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really\\nrather be playing golf, don\\'t really give a damn.  Of course I can\\'t say this\\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\\ndon\\'t think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\\nhuman attitudes.  \\n\\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \\nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\\n\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\\ngoing to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but these\\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \\ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\\na decent living. \\n\\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \\nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\\n\\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \\nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The \\nemphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted\\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\\nleague over the year.  They proved it.\\n\\ncordially, as always,\\n\\nrm\\n\\n\\n     Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in \\'65 or \\'66?  True,\\nCone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,\\nthese teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with\\nlots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn\\'t use relievers, whereas\\nJeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.\\n     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb\\npitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There\\'s more of a\\nchance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no\\npitching.  At least, to me.\\n     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team\\nwith Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real\\norder, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but\\nwith a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)\\nOr a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,\\nMays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.\\n     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by\\nseasons\\' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in\\ntheir best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all\\nthe players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all\\nthe offense would have to do is get 1 run across.\\n     I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all-\\ntime teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results\\nI would love to see that.Caps/Isles Fans,\\n\\nAnyone interested in catching the games from Nassau\\nColiseum (hopefully there will be another) can catch\\nthe game at North Carolina\\'s Original Sports Bar in\\nChapel Hill.  I\\'m pretty sure they carry HTS as well.\\nThey had all three games on at the same\\ntime last night.  This is the only place I know to\\ncatch all of the Stanley Cup action.\\nI\\'m glad Grant Fuhr will never be as over-confident after two wins\\nas you are...it takes four wins to defeat an opponent...each tougher\\nto obtain than the previous one.

He has batted in the 340\\'s for a season, drove in 100 and more runs  \\nmany times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300  \\nwhile knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield\\'s  \\nslugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that  \\ndave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was  \\none of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit  \\nthe scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new  \\nStadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence  \\nsince it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his  \\nhitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds  \\nof last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an  \\nuppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,  \\nand my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George  \\ninviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the  \\nYankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?  \\nFor 3 million dollars, he\\'ll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5  \\nmillion this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play  \\nthe field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should  \\ngive the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age  \\nof Yankee domination.\\nWell, since you mentioned it...\\n\\n  \\n\\nNo question here.

Bleep! Bleep!  The Bruins lost AGAIN in O.T.  I can\\'t stand it!\\n\\nAside from frustrated ravings, I must give Buffalo credit: they are making good \\non most of their scoring opportunities, and are playing great defense.  Boston\\nplayers can\\'t seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net\\nexcept for on rare occasions.  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent\\njob clearing away rebounds.  Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed\\nbut he\\'s also getting plenty of help.\\nBoston has been playing rather well (better than would be indicated by the \\nseries score of 3-0) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the \\ngame.  As a result, Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period\\n2 goals down.  This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single\\ngame (the outlook for the Bruin\\'s advancement to the second round are quite\\nbleak).  IMHO, the Bruins NEED to score first.  If they can do that, they have\\nan excellent chance of winning, since they have outplayed the Sabres in the \\n2nd and 3rd periods.\\n\\n(The scary thing is that I\\'ll be going to grad school in Buffalo next year.\\n   I\\'ll never cheer for the Sabres... You can\\'t convert me... ^:)\\n\\n\\nMTM3\\n\\n\\tYou know what Frank? It\\'s not David Poile\\'s fault that the Caps\\nhave mired in mediocrity for so long.

He\\'s unwilling to spend the bucks in \\norder to get a big star to Landover...no wonder both teams STINK!\\n\\n\\tI\\'ve heard that the Capitals had a chance to get Detroit\\'s\\nSteve Yzerman last summer but they pulled out at the last minute.

It just seems \"right\" that the hotbed of\\namateur hockey in the USA should have an NHL team as well.

After the official scorer balances the\\nofficial score card, they copy it and give it to several diffent people. \\nOne of those is a person from AP whose job it is to type it up (using a\\ntemplate on a laptop) and transmit it to the AP offices in New York\\n(Rockefeller Center) via the telephone.  The box scores are not checked\\nand just rebroadcasted over AP\\'s news delivery services.  If there are\\ncorrections, those are issued later.  It is the person sitting in front\\nof a laptop at Shea (or whereever) whose fault that is.  [NOTE: The AP\\nputs out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in\\nmost newspapers being the first one]\\n\\nLast week they were in Denver.  Maybe the AP person in Denver did this\\n(remember, they just started with MLB out there).

Gant may have said something here, too.\\n\\n\\nCox was already halfway to the ump when the strike was called.\\n\\n\\nMy impression was that Gant was not \\'stepping out.\\'  He was making\\na protest about the lack of an appeal to first.  As has been\\npointed out earlier, there is no appeal to first on a strike.\\nI can understand Gant feeling a little pressure in a two-out,\\nRISP, 1 - 0 game, ninth inning.  He let it get to him.  The ump\\nalso overreacted.  Gant was stalking off, but I doubt he would\\nhave been gone long.  Hirschbeck should have let him have a\\nmoment to compose himself before telling him to come bat.\\nIMHO, umpires should be more flexible than what Hirschbeck\\nshowed.

Why?\\n: Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does\\n: Toronto have?\\n\\nWell, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does\\neveryone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded\\nspot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters\\nthan lefthanded batters.  I just don\\'t understand why people insist\\non lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).\\nMost batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have\\nthe platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.\\nI guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams\\nmay be more vulnerable to LHP\\'s than RHP\\'s.  However, this is probably\\nonly a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters\\nfor this reason during the regular season.\\n\\nI think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of\\nwhether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have\\nhigher ERA\\'s than righthanded starters, precisely because managers\\ngo out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of\\nthe platoon advantage).\\n\\nAm I missing something here?\\nSorry Len, this is exactly how he suffered from being rushed to the bigs.\\nBeing overweight and having no work ethic, leading to being injury prone with\\nnothing to loose, might have been corrected in Richmond.

Most of the Flames neglected\\nto show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least\\nfive posts! The Flames best line was probably\\nSkrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary\\nSuter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored\\nby D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made\\nsome bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially\\nimpressive. \\n\\nThe games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and\\nnever recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,\\nhits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren\\nRychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed\\nto take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don\\'t think\\nVernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,\\nas Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King\\ninserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday\\'s\\ngame. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no\\nidea how serious - he didn\\'t return.\\n\\nI still think the Flames should win this series, but they better\\nbuckle down.News:\\n=====\\nFor the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player\\nremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not \\na major part of the team. \\n\\nTrent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season\\ngame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has\\nalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 1:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with\\nLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing\\nbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that\\nwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and \\ntry and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky\\nKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames\\nconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren\\nFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren\\nRychel\\'s face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. \\n\\nGoaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the\\nloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got\\nvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and \\nsweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley\\'s goal actually went in off\\nChris Dahlquist\\'s skate in front of the net. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 2:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the\\npotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.\\nThe first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary\\ncame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring\\nfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. \\n\\nThe deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary\\ndominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better\\nuse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary\\nalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up\\na shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.\\'s powerplay goal also came late in the\\ngame with the outcome already decided. The Kings\\' powerplay failed them when\\nthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. \\n\\nThe Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he\\nwas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary\\'s 7th goal. Charlie\\nHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. \\n\\nThe game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of\\nCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for\\ninstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato\\ndrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed\\n30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct\\nfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a\\nfight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and\\nYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil \\nturtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at \\neach other was just roughing?

He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In\\ncase anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe\\nRuth and is 72.  Mize\\'s record may not last for much longer because of Juan\\nGonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that \\nhe had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don\\'t have any record\\nbooks at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I \\nam wrong.  \\n\\tOnto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don\\'t here anything in Los Angeles and I\\ncan\\'t get McPaper consistently around here.  \\ncomment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals\\nthat brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could \\nhit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish\\nwith .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark\\'s numbers.  \\nleadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I\\'m \\nlucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He\\'s got 4 steals\\nalready.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I\\nhaven\\'t seen Stillwell\\'s name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going\\nto use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this\\nyear is stealing bases.\\nSheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.\\nWitness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,\\nor anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don\\'t hear anything.\\nAndy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of \\'91?   or is \\nthis a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?   Has anyone \\nseen him pitch the two good games?\\nscore for today, Sunday april 18:  Padres 10, St Louis 6.  Padres sweep the\\nCardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer.  Sheffield and Tueful also homer\\nin a winning cause.  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThanks for listening-reading\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany comments????\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, when you say, without Morris, you have to mention an assumed\\nreplacement.  If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston\\nsoft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days, then\\nof course the Blue Jays wouldn\\'t have won without Morris.  If the\\nalternative was replacement level, then I think it would\\'ve been very\\nclose, and yes, Morris might\\'ve made the difference.  If the alternative\\nwas Frank Viola, the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with\\nViola.\\n\\n\\nYes.  You can make the argument that the his presence prevented \\nthe team from collapsing in August.\\n\\n\\nThose innings were probably helpful.\\n\\n\\nWell, I think is complete bs.  What happened most of the time is that\\nMorris fell behind, and the team came back and rescued him.  Mostly,\\nthis is because he\\'s a lousy 1st inning pitcher, and much better\\nthe rest of the way.  That the team can climb out of 4-0, 5-0 holes\\nconsistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris\\' credit; it\\'s to the\\nteam\\'s credit.\\n\\nFurthermore, while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that would\\nbe projected from his runs allowed and run support, he hasn\\'t done\\nthis in previous years.  In fact, his W-L record in 1991 is a lot\\nworse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed.\\nDo you think he just came up with this ability in 1992.\\n\\nLook at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in.  Typical\\nMorris games.  Morris gets behind; team rescues him.  He\\'s not\\nresponsible for that rescue.  And in both those games, the team\\njust didn\\'t rescue him enough.  Jack Morris pitched as well as he did\\nduring much of the season in those 2 games; the offense just didn\\'t\\nearn him a victory.\\n\\n\\nMorris is one of those guys who will reture when he can\\'t start\\nanymore; he\\'s too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen.\\n\\nHow do you know they can be shortened by half-an-hour?  Has anybody done a\\nstudy to determine how much time is actually \"wasted\" -- say, in these A\\'s\\ngames?\\n\\nno kidding...just ask the White Sox...\\n\\ntoo bad, really...\\n\\n-John NeuharthHere are the standings after game 2 of each of the divisional semi-final\\nseries.\\n\\n\\t- Andrew\\n\\nUSENET Hockey Playoff Draft Standings\\n\\nPosn\\tTeam\\t\\t\\t\\tPts\\tRem\\tLast Posn\\n\\n1.\\tSneddon Scorers                 77\\t25\\t(1)\\n2.\\tArctic Circles                  75\\t25\\t(75)\\n\\tNorthern Lights                 75\\t25\\t(33)\\n\\tThreepeat                       75\\t25\\t(19)\\n5.\\tfighting amish                  74\\t25\\t(161)\\n\\tTeam Elvis                      74\\t25\\t(11)\\n7.\\tchris roney                     73\\t25\\t(33)\\n\\tMyers Marauders                 73\\t25\\t(--)\\n\\tthe dead ducks                  73\\t25\\t(11)\\n10.\\tLes Poteux                      72\\t25\\t(--)\\n\\tSludge                          72\\t25\\t(75)\\n\\tPaige Faults                    72\\t25\\t(33)\\n\\tSam & His Dogs                  72\\t25\\t(33)\\n\\tThe Borg                        72\\t25\\t(2)\\n\\tHurricane Andrew                72\\t25\\t(4)\\n\\tLewey\\'s Lakers                  72\\t25\\t(102)\\n\\tEinstien\\'s Punk Band            72\\t25\\t(9)\\n18.\\tHomesick Hawaiian               71\\t25\\t(4)\\n\\tTest Department                 71\\t25\\t(11)\\n\\tSamuel Lau (Calgary, Alberta)   71\\t25\\t(127)\\n\\tMopar Muscle Men                71\\t25\\t(33)\\n\\tJerky Boys                      71\\t24\\t(4)\\n\\tGB Flyers                       71\\t25\\t(19)\\n24.\\tNeural Netters                  70\\t25\\t(102)\\n\\tgive you money monday           70\\t25\\t(9)\\n\\tBill McGreer                    70\\t25\\t(--)\\n\\tFugazi                          70\\t25\\t(33)\\n\\tDetroit Homeboy                 70\\t25\\t(11)\\n\\tBloom County All-Stars          70\\t25\\t(54)\\n\\tDehraDun Maawalis               70\\t25\\t(75)\\n31.\\tGreat Expectations              69\\t25\\t(4)\\n\\tPURDUE RICKS PENS               69\\t25\\t(19)\\n33.\\tfrank\\'s little wankers          68\\t25\\t(33)\\n\\tJan Stein                       68\\t25\\t(33)\\n\\tAllez les Blues                 68\\t25\\t(--)\\n\\tGoaldingers                     68\\t25\\t(75)\\n\\tsuds                            68\\t25\\t(19)\\n\\tweenies                         68\\t25\\t(33)\\n\\tA.P.

Malarchuk immediately fell to the ice, hands at\\nhis neck, blood on the ice.\\n\\nHe\\'d been suffering from it for over a decade.  He just wasn\\'t\\ndiagnosed for it until he didn\\'t sleep for ten days and decided to\\nhave some alcohol to help him sleep.

He might see a movie about\\nsomething and automatically assume the situation is the same for his\\nown life.  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes,\\nbut still needs it.  He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD\\nepisode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days.  (He felt\\nit slowed his reflexes, so he tried to go without).

I\\'m planning on getting there an hour or  \\n     two early and paying through the nose for parking to keep things easy. \\n\\n  2) Is it probable that I\\'ll be able to walk up and get bleacher seats (2 or\\n     3) on game day? I figure since it\\'s early in the year, Ryno\\'s out and \\n     the weather isn\\'t great I should be able to get tickets. If not, what\\'s \\n     the best way to get advance tickets; can I call the Cubs\\' ticket office\\n     directly and pick up tickets at the will call window?  \\n\\n  3) Any advice on where to eat before or after the game? \\n\\n  4) Do they allow inflatable I-luv-ewe dolls (present from Lundy) into the \\n     bleachers? :-) \\n \\n\\nI don\\'t \"notice\" refs and linesmen until the playoffs come around, and\\nyes I have to agree that Stewart called the *two* worst games I\\'ve seen\\nso far (Mtl-Quebec game 1, and last nights Toronto-Detroit game).\\n\\nWhat\\'s the scoop on this guy?

HELLOOOO!!!!! The Sabres \\nare AHEAD 2 games to 0, not behind.  As a life-long Sabres fan, I am well \\naware of their ability to choke, but let\\'s not exaggerate that.  As long as \\nthe Sabres win one of the next 2 games (be it game 3 OR game 4), they are \\nstill in good shape (ahead 3 games to 1), with game 6 to be played at \\nBuffalo.  If they lose games three AND four, then start worrying.

If the\\nSabres-Bruins ends early then we\\'ll go to the Devils-Penguins game\\n(assuming that ESPN follows their previous patterns; we got the last\\nminute of the Islanders-Rangers and all of the overtime two weeks\\nago).

It doesn\\'t look like Buffalo will just lose\\ntheir next two games at the Aud with the way Fuhr has been standing on\\nhis head.\\n\\nBasically,the Bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend.\\nAlso,it seems like the whole Boston area has gone baseball crazy after\\nan incredibly great start by the Red Sox(best record in their major\\nleagues as of now). I would say that 70% of the callers to the Bruins\\'\\nflagship station(SportsRadio 590) are talking about the Red Sox,about\\n15% are yapping about the Patriots\\' upcoming draft,10% are on the Celtics\\nand about 5% are on the Bruins.\\nSomehow,no one around here is really schocked the way Bruins are folding\\nearly.\\nAfter reading my local paper today, I found out that the Phillies\\nstarted the 1964 season at 10-2.  I am not as old as 1964, but I\\'ve\\nheard many talk about the serious choke job the Phillies did that\\nseason. They were ahead of the Cardinals by 15 games that season in\\nmid-August.

His\\n1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to\\nthird base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF,\\nhe began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.\\n\\nBut no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye\\nover the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding,\\nhe was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came\\nup through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through\\n2 position changes in the space of a year.  He\\'s an adequate OF,\\nalthough not great, and at least some of your perception of his\\nfielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the\\nML level.  (I know you\\'re another long-term Braves fan :)\\n\\nAbout playing 3B...IMO, that\\'s the 2nd most DIFFICULT position\\nto field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and \\nspeed, but at 3B, you\\'ve got to have quick reflexes and have \\na GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when\\nplaying sandlot softball!  Granted, I\\'d still put my best\\noverall infielder at SS, but that\\'s because he gets more\\nchances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me\\nthat so many teams have tried to convert other position players\\nto 3B.  But maybe that\\'s because the supply of \"natural\" 3B is\\nscarce.\\n\\nFinally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to\\nperform well, and works hard to improve.  You don\\'t get\\nthose amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a\\nlot of weight work.  Now, whether he\\'s been overdoing it these\\ndays may be a valid question, as is the question of whether\\nhe tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.\\nBut frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,\\nI\\'d much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not\\ntrying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation\\nto an adult; but at that age I don\\'t believe you can teach\\nhustle.\\n\\nAll that said, I don\\'t think I\\'d sign Gant to another long-term\\ncontract.  He\\'s 28 now, and I think he\\'s free-agent eligible\\nin 2 years, when he\\'ll be 30.  Given his career curve and\\nlimitations, I wouldn\\'t expect him to last much past 35\\nas a ML ballplayer.  He might surprise me here, but Atlanta\\'s\\ngot some talent on the farm, and I\\'d rather take my chances\\ndown the road with Nieves et al.That more or less says it.  I flicked the Penguins game on briefly and saw\\nUlf cross-check Valeri in the face.  I am wondering if Don Cherry is going to\\ngo off on this at all in coach\\'s corner.\\n\\nbillcMy dad has always blamed the Phillies collapse in \\'64 on me...  On Sept 21,  1964,  the Phillies had something like a 9 game lead with 12 to play.  I was born on Sept 21,  1964.  The Phils proceeded to lose something like 10 straight while the Cards won 10 straight (does anyone know hte exact numbers?),  and a pennant was blown.  To this day my dad likes to remind me that it all began when I was born!\\nNote that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various SC\\nand Prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local NHL owners.\\nWhen/If Cablevision VP Chuck Dolan\\'s purchase of the Islanders goes\\nthrough, the Islanders will be back solidly in the SCNY fold (their\\noriginal owners were, and they\\'ve remained due to a lucrative TV\\ncontract).  The Flyer Snyders own the Philadelphia SC as well as the\\nPrism pay channel.  There are six teams affiliated with regional SC\\'s,\\nanother half dozen affiliated with Prime outlets, and other locals\\nlike HTS and NESN who have barter arrangements.  With all this\\ncross-ownership, I was surprised that ESPN got the deal this \\nseason!!\\n\\ngld\\n\\tYeah, maybe that is more likely.  But from the Mariners-Tigers \\nseries, it seems like every time there are base runners, the pitchers \\nseem to purposely pitch around him or give him a free pass.  The \\nfunny thing was that Griffey was struggling up until the last game of the\\nfour game series if I remember correctly.\\n\\n- Chung YangQuebec dominated Habs for first 2 periods and only Roy kept\\nthis one from being rout, although he did blow 2nd goal.\\nCanadians showed up in third but Nords were playing dump &\\npull back most of the time. Hextall made some good saves but\\nreally this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3\\n& could have had 5, plus another 4 in 2nd. Canadians are dead\\nmeat, they may take one or 2 but this one is over. Tee it up\\nJacques, next time you might rest players & forget about 1st\\nplace, welcome to the Adams division.: I think most of the problems mainly arose from Manager Gene Mauch\\'s\\n: ineptitude in managing the pitching staff.  Down the stretch, he\\n: abused Jim Bunning, Chris Short, and Robin Roberts (I think those\\n: are the three) pitching each on only 2 days rest for quite some\\n: time.  By the time they hit the last 2 weeks of the season,\\n: obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm.  Oh\\n: well.\\n\\nRoberts was long gone -- he was probably an Oriole in 1964.  Or maybe a\\nColt .45.  The 3rd starter was Art Mahaffey, the previous year\\'s ace.\\nDennis Bennett was the 4th starter.\\n\\nThey were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go, but they won their final two\\ngames after the horrid 10-loss streak.  The final game victory\\n(Bunning\\'s 19th win, if memory serves) kept the Reds from tying for the\\ntitle; they and the Phils were both 1 game behind the Cards, with the\\nGiants(?) another game back.  The Mets couldn\\'t hold an early lead\\nagainst the Cards that final Sunday, or there would have been a 3-way\\ntie.  Too bad they couldn\\'t have saved some of the 15 or so runs they\\nscored on Saturday when they crushed St. Louis.\\n--\\nHe\\'s a Canadian \"thing\". Former coach of the Boston Bruins and Colorado\\nRockies. From the summaries that get posted I gather that his ongoing beef\\nthis year has been the conventional wisdom that Canadian hockey is doomed\\nto be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the U.S.\\nand European programs.\\n\\n\\nAfter he left the Rockies, he got a job with CBC\\'s Hockey Night in Canada\\nand hasn\\'t looked back since. Actually, he did work for CBC at least\\non playoff season after the Rockies were eliminated.\\n\\n\\nI\\'d say it\\'s a combination of flame bait and serious journalism.

If his defense is good enough for\\nGreenville, or Richmond, it\\'s good enough for Atlanta. If he really was\\nawful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.\\n\\n\\nOh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players.\\nSolid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really\\naren\\'t very good at baseball.

I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon\\nBerryhill aren\\'t exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years,\\nBerryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash.

That does qualify you on r.s.b.\\nWe\\'ll make an SDCN out of you, yet :-)\\nTim Shippert recently posted summaries of last year\\'s Defensive Average\\nstats in terms of the Linear Weights estimated run-value of defensive\\nperformances, compared to league average.  I\\'ve combined those with my\\nposition-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation total\\nrun values for players last year.  We can use these as a springboard for\\nreconsideration of the MVP award.\\n\\nMajor caveats:  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if\\nSan Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the\\ninfield, that will cause some inaccuracies.  The offensive numbers are\\nposition-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and\\ninflate others to be fair.  Finally, we still don\\'t know what to do about\\ncatchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions \\nof Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts.  \\n\\nHaving said that, there are still some surprises.  Let\\'s look National\\nLeague first.  All numbers in total runs contributed over the season.\\n\\n\\tPlayer\\t\\tOffense\\t\\tDefense\\t\\tTotal\\n\\n\\tSandberg\\t  44\\t\\t  32\\t\\t 76\\n\\tBonds\\t\\t  67\\t\\t   3\\t\\t 70\\n\\tWalker\\t\\t  26\\t\\t  26\\t\\t 52\\n\\tJustice\\t\\t  14\\t\\t  33\\t\\t 47\\n\\tDaulton\\t \\t  44\\t\\t  ??\\t\\t 44+?\\n\\tLarkin\\t\\t  36\\t\\t   4\\t\\t 40\\n\\tGrace\\t\\t  13\\t\\t  27\\t\\t 40\\n\\nAs I see it, these are the legitimate MVP candidates from last season.\\nIf you deflate Sandberg\\'s offense a wee bit for playing in Wrigley, you\\nget essentially a dead heat.  Had Bonds been his usual defensive self, it\\nwouldn\\'t have been close, but that apparently wasn\\'t the case.  Darren\\nDaulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference,\\nand I couldn\\'t tell you whether that\\'s easy or impossible.  A good case \\ncould be made for any of Sandberg, Bonds, or Daulton as top dude.\\n\\nMy personal vote:  Bonds, Sandberg, Daulton, Walker, Justice.\\n\\n\\nIn the American League:\\n\\n\\tPlayer\\t\\tOffense\\t\\tDefense\\t\\tTotal\\n\\n\\tVentura\\t\\t  22\\t\\t  34\\t\\t 56\\n\\tMartinez\\t  47\\t\\t  -1\\t\\t 46\\n\\tB.

I certainly didn\\'t, but I\\'d have a hard time\\narguing against him at this point.  Yes, I know these numbers are only\\napproximate, but that\\'s a big gap between him and the #2 guy.  Also, those\\nof you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds.\\n\\nOnce again, there\\'s a catcher in the ointment.  If calling a game is as\\nimportant as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away).  TAke\\na guess, folks; I don\\'t think we can do any better than that.\\n\\nMy personal vote (excluding pitchers):\\n\\n\\tVentura, Tettleton, Anderson, Martinez, Henderson.\\n\\nI\\'m a big Frank Thomas fan, but I have to admit to a bias in favor of\\nbalanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higher\\nleverage in W/L record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with\\nnegative defense.\\n\\nFor the record:\\n\\n\\tCarlos Baerga\\t\\t  27\\t\\t  5\\t\\t  32\\n\\tRoberto Alomar\\t\\t  35\\t\\t -2\\t\\t  33\\n\\nForget it; it\\'s a wash.\\n\\nLet me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regarding\\nDon Mattingly\\'s defense this past season.  Don recovered brilliantly from his\\nweak \\'90 and \\'91 to end up with\\n\\n\\tMattingly\\t\\t  -1\\t\\t  17\\t\\t  16 runs\\n\\nwhich is clearly an above-average first baseman.  However, it\\'s still 18 runs\\nbehind Mark McGwire, 26 runs behind Frank Thomas, and 7 runs behind John\\nOlerud.  On the other hand, it\\'s ahead of Rafael Palmeiro, Cecil Fielder, and\\nevery other AL first baseman not yet mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI too am of the same  sentiment Bart, but realistically, this town DOESN\\'T WANT TO pay for \\nquality player and hence we are loosing these people left, right and center.\\nLabour is also responsible for their boycott Pocklington movement.\\nI would like the Oilers to stay, but realistically, given this situation, it\\'s \\nbye-bye Oilers.} >>\\n} >>>Has Jack lost a bit of his edge?

(-:  Invariably, all the\\narguments from people who don\\'t like to watch baseball on T.V. say the\\nsame thing:  the games are too long and too boring.  Baseball is trying\\nto find a way to shorten the games for wider T.V. appeal.  If you look at\\nit, though, baseball games last around the same amount of time as football\\ngames.  The difference is that there is \"more action\" in that duration in\\nfootball games.  Perhaps if there were \"more action\" in baseball games, you\\nwould get more of those fans to tune in.  Anyway, coming up with a solution\\nto make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult.\\n[On soapbox] Yet another reason to get a commisioner NOW since it\\'s obvious\\nthat ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in\\nNebraska.

AAAGGGHHH!\\n\\nNow *this* is a legitimate point.  Baseball is entertainment, and I have no\\nquarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than\\nothers, regardless of their win-value.  Personally, I\\'m a huge fan of the\\nslug-bunt; I doubt it\\'s a high-percentage play, but I get a big kick out of\\nit.  I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun.\\n\\nOf course, this is *not* the same as claiming (as some do) that Galarraga\\'s\\ninability to defer gratification isn\\'t hurting his team because he \"isn\\'t\\npaid to walk\" or \"is an RBI guy\" or whatever.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not sure.  I used to think this was true, but more and more I\\'m becoming\\nconvinced that it\\'s the other way around: among players with the physical\\nability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the\\nchance to do it a lot.\\n\\nLet\\'s break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether\\nthey are power threats and whether they walk a lot:\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tPower\\t\\t\\tNo Power\\n\\n\\tPatient\\t\\tFrank Thomas\\t\\tBrett Butler\\n\\t\\t\\tBarry Bonds\\t\\tOzzie Smith\\n\\t\\t\\tMark McGwire\\t\\tCraig Grebeck\\n\\t\\t\\tBabe Ruth\\t\\tMiller Huggins\\n\\t\\t\\tTed Williams\\t\\tBilly Hamilton\\n\\t\\t\\tRickey Henderson\\tEddie Joost\\n\\t\\t\\tJoe Morgan\\t\\tMike Hargrove\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\n\\tImpatient\\tErnie Banks\\t\\tOzzie Guillen\\n\\t\\t\\tDave Kingman\\t\\tShawon Dunston\\n\\t\\t\\tJoe Carter\\t\\tAndres Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tGeorge Bell\\t\\tJose Lind\\n\\t\\t\\tKirby Puckett\\t\\tDevon White\\n\\tetc.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, all the categories are full.

Part of that, undoubtedly, is being\\nsmall of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of \\ntarget at least 3 times out of 6.

However, I\\'d suggest Kelly\\nBuchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for\\nthe All-Star game notwithstanding.\\n\\nAs for biggest surprise, I\\'d say that Buchberger had higher expectations\\nthis year due to his \"breakthrough\" year (for him) last year, so he didn\\'t\\nreally raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the\\ncallups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the\\ndepth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on\\nthe team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent\\nnumbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league\\noblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.\\nI think he\\'ll be on the full-time roster next year.\\n\\nAs for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers\\ndumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or\\neven Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn\\'t far off.\\n\\n-- \\nAndrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com\\nHP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253Count me interested in a Cardinal\\'s mailing list.

Bowman is a great coach...Johnson,\\n: a very good one.  However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and\\n: Patrick\\'s solution of having him only run the team on game days, and\\n: delegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is\\n: a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick\\'s part.  \\n\\nIMHO Bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at \\nthis time. Johnson was the perfect coach two years ago for his \\ngroup of players. I would say we have been very lucky here in \\nPittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one. \\n(Excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the \\nchange.) With the immense talent on the Penguins roster this \\nyear, a tougher Bowman keeps the egos in check. Johnson on the \\nother hand, was able to inspire the younger, inexperienced players \\nto new heights. Both coaches have / had different strengths. Both \\nof which came at exactly the right time. \\n\\nAnother person also mentioned that Bowman is the perfect coach \\nfor this time since nobody can argue with his decisions. How can \\nyou argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway? \\nPlaying for a great coach like that demands respect which also \\nkeeps the egos in check. \\n\\nJust a couple of ideas.\\n\\n\\nAw, just take a moment to digest it and I\\'m sure you\\'ll see the humour...\\nPray for the Wings to become lazy and overconfident...the Wings\\ncan only lose the series...Toronto cannot win it.

desparate for some playoff action\\n(especially the Cannucks).  Does anyone know of a sports bar on the Bay\\nPeninsula that will be showing hockey games.  I\\'m looking for something \\nbetween redwood City and Mountain View.\\n\\nI dunno about hat. I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that\\nOttawa\\'s gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Pronger. Daigle has\\nshown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne\\'t liked,\\nand after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being\\nstupid, he\\'s really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a\\nrock. \\n\\nAlso remember that a lot of teh \"draft 1st\" stuff comes from the assumption\\nhe\\'ll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It\\'s not clear that \\nQuebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current\\nstatus. He\\'s still first round, but I don\\'t consider him a first pick lock\\nby any means at this point.\\n\\nIt\\'s also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his\\nsigning price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos\\nsuspensions.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo. Kariya won\\'t go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he\\'s not\\nleaving college, and I don\\'t believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to\\nuse a first for someone who won\\'t be around for another year or two, not\\nwhen there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make\\nan immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards\\nNiedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can\\nconvince him to leave school early (which I doubt).\\n\\n\\nMy cut on things as they stand today:\\n\\n\\t(it depends on if the Sharks can get a deal for him. I don\\'t\\n\\tbelieve they draft him to keep him).\\nAntonio,you weren\\'t alone.\\n\\nABC ratings were very good. I was schocked to hear that ABC\\'s telecast\\nwas the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend. National\\nrating came out to a very respectable 3.3. Top-29 Nielsen markets were\\nat 2.9. In Boston,the game scored lower at 2.4 but it had some competion\\nfrom local sports teams.\\nQuite frankly, I expected ABC\\'s ratings to be under 2.0. But I\\'m happy\\nto be proven wrong!\\n\\nWell,well...Sometimes it pays off clicking away on your cable-tv remote\\ncontrol.:-) And if you happen to be a hockey fan,you could just stumble\\nupon a playoff hockey game...\\n\\nESPN picked up Detroit-Toronto game on Monday night because the only\\nnight game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago. You have to give\\nESPN credit for switching to Detroit\\'s FOX-50 coverage and having Bill\\nClement at a Pittsburgh\\'s TV station(WATE?) for intermission analysis.\\nMaybe,ESPN people were giddy over perliminary over-night ABC ratings\\nfor Sunday\\'s telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the\\nNorris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion.\\nGood move,ESPN!\\n\\n\\nRight Gerald.  And take away Bob Probert and the Wings are dead Octopuses.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s wait for the body to get cold before we start in with the eulogies\\nhm?  They have only lost ONE game.  The game was in Detroit after all and\\nPotvin did not have his best evening.  Nobody that I saw thought that the\\nLeafs would sweep the Wings.  It looks like it might go six.

But\\n   what I don\\'t understand is that they cut the OT just show some stupid\\n   baseball news which is not important at all. Then I waited for the scores\\n   to comeon Sportscenter, but they talk about Baseball, basketball and \\n   football. Then they showed Penguine highlight and went back to stupid\\n   basketball. Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that\\n   was like 30 sec. I think they should give more attention to NHl during\\n   the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games..\\n\\n   I guess it is NHL\\'s fault too for leaving ESPN.

Anybody who plays\\nthe way he does, does not belong in the NHL. There have been cheap shot artists\\nthrough the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players.\\nBobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has been\\nout right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbed\\nand players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don\\'t belong. When players\\nlike Ulf, who\\'s main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed\\nto continue, and the league won\\'t stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000\\naluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get\\na chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day.\\nThe sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a\\nStanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers\\nin the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not\\neven notice he\\'s gone. He\\'s an eyesore on the game of hockey.\\n1993 World Championships in Germany:\\n ====================================\\n\\n Group A results:\\n\\n RUSSIA - SWITZERLAND  6-0 (2-0,1-0,3-0)\\n\\n 1st: RUS 1-0  Alexei Yashin 1          5:23\\n      RUS 2-0  Alexei Yashin 2         16:45\\n 2nd: RUS 3-0  Ilia Biakin 1            7:13\\n 3rd: RUS 4-0  Andrei Khomutov 3        3:47\\n      RUS 5-0  Ilia Biakin 2            4:13\\n      RUS 6-0  Sergei Sorokin 1        13:50\\n\\n Penalties: RUS 7*2min 1*5min game penalty, SWI 9*2min\\n Referee: Rob Hearn, USA\\n Attendance: 3,500\\n\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n CANADA - AUSTRIA  11-0 (6-0,2-0,3-0)\\n\\n 1st: CAN  1-0  Shayne Corson 1         9:51\\n      CAN  2-0  Rod Brind\\'Amour 2      10:24\\n      CAN  3-0  Paul Kariya 1          12:42\\n      CAN  4-0  Gerry Galley 1         18:23\\n      CAN  5-0  Eric Lindros 2         19:11\\n      CAN  6-0  Rod Brind\\'Amour 3      19:46\\n 2nd: CAN  7-0  Eric Lindros 3          0:31\\n      CAN  8-0  Eric Lindros 4          8:50\\n 3rd: CAN  9-0  Brian Savage 1         13:37\\n      CAN 10-0  Brian Benning 1        16:26\\n      CAN 11-0  Geoff Sanderson 3      17:55\\n\\n Penalties: CAN 2*2min, AUT 2*2min\\n Attendance: 7,500\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n USA - FRANCE  6-1 (3-1,1-0,2-0)\\n\\n 1st: FRA 0-1  Antoine Richer 1         5:02\\n      USA 1-1  Adam Burt 1              8:32\\n      USA 2-1  Rob Gaudreau 1          18:15\\n      USA 3-1  Jeff Lazaro 1           18:29\\n 2nd: USA 4-1  Adam Burt 2             10:54\\n 3rd: USA 5-1  Shjon Podein 1           8:03\\n      USA 6-1  Rob Gaudreau 2          16:25\\n\\n Penalties: USA 3*2min, FRA 2*2min\\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\\n Attendance: 1,511\\n\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n FINLAND - NORWAY  2-0 (0-0,0-0,2-0)\\n\\n 1st:\\n 2nd:\\n 3rd: FIN 1-0  Juha Riihijarvi 1        4:16\\n      FIN 2-0  Kari Harila 1           12:37\\n\\n Penalties: FIN 5*2min, NOR 7*2min\\n Referee: Sven-Erik Sold, Sweden\\n Attendance: 3,600\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n The best goal scorers:\\n\\n Eric Lindros\\t\\tCAN\\t4\\n Rod Brind\\'Amour\\tCAN\\t3\\n Dieter Hegen\\t\\tGER\\t3\\n Andrei Khomutov\\tRUS\\t3\\n Geoff Sanderson\\tCAN\\t3\\n Ilia Biakin\\t\\tRUS\\t2\\n Adam Burt\\t\\tUSA\\t2\\n Viacheslav Bykov\\tRUS\\t2\\n Jiri Dolezal\\t\\tCZE\\t2\\n Mike Gartner\\t\\tCAN\\t2\\n Rob Gaudreau\\t\\tUSA\\t2\\n Patrik Juhlin\\t\\tSWE\\t2\\n Frank Pajonkowski\\tFRA\\t2\\n Bernd Truntschka\\tGER\\t2\\n Jarkko Varvio\\t\\tFIN\\t2\\n Alexei Yashin\\t\\tRUS\\t2\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n Some WC stats:\\n\\n *  Fastest goal in a WC game after first face-off:\\n\\n    10 seconds:\\t    Steve Larmer, Canada  1991 in a game vs Sweden (ended 3-3)\\n                    Boris Michailov, USSR   1978\\n\\n *  Most consecutive WC games without a loss:\\n\\n    47:   USSR    1978-85\\n    38:   USSR    1963-68\\n    37:   Canada  1937-49\\n    35:   USSR    1985-90\\n    27:   Canada  1950-54\\nI have some advice for you, and some thoughts about\\nyour hatred of the Minnesota North Stars:\\n\\n1.

AFC CHAMPIONSHIP, JANUARY 17, 1992..#21\\tPETER AHOLA\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B)\\n\\nIt is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the\\nPenguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had\\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it\\'s actually less; the San Jose\\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn\\'t been\\nspectacular, and his offense isn\\'t anything to write home about (8 points);\\nit\\'s even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\\nout to be ... Peter Ahola.\\n\\n#24\\tDOUG WILSON\\t\\tSeason: 16th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and\\n\\t\\t2nd round pick in \\'92 entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B)\\n\\nI have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high\\nexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.\\nNevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and\\nplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,\\nunfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to\\ncatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for\\n2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be\\nWilson\\'s last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\\n\\n#29\\tDEAN KOLSTAD\\t\\tSeason:\\t2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (C-/D+)\\n\\nIt\\'s probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he\\'s\\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\\n\\n#38\\tPAT MACLEOD\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\\nhe wouldn\\'t clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\\nSince he has played so little, I can\\'t even give a tentative grade on him, but\\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\\nskills.\\n\\n#41\\tTOM PEDERSON\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+)\\n\\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\\n43 games.  However, his size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\\n\\n#45\\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (D+/D)\\n\\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that\\nwill go down in Scremin\\'s entry of league stats is probably the fact that he\\nwas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.I\\'ve never heard of the Bob Dylan Baseball Abstract, but I am curious.\\nCould someone clue me in?\\n\\n--\\n--------------------------\\nPhil Brown                |\\naka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs the answer as simple as that you dislike russians???\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd where would canadian hockey be today without the europeans??

Now that the fan has Mike\\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \\nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \\nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \\n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\\nMorning show:\\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \\nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\\nit was a major story.\\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\\nstyles of host.\\n\\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \\nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \\nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning \\'guys\\')\\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \\neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\\nyou can\\'t get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\\n\\n2PM to 4PM:\\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \\nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\\nare often hilarious.  \\n\\n4 PM to 7 PM:\\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\\nMike Missanelli but I just can\\'t stomach Steve Fredericks.  \\nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\\nhomer now.  I don\\'t listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \\nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\\n\\n7 PM to Midnight:\\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\\nJets, or St. John\\'s basketball.  If the game is on the\\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\\nDuring the summer, it\\nis all talk on WIP.\\n\\n\\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \\n\\n\\n\\n            Rich\\nWhy not? Horner played 130 games in 1985 and hit 27 HR.\\nMurphy played 162 and hit 37.\\nIn 1986 Horner hit 27 in 141 games and Murphy hit 29 in 160 games.\\n(and the Braves lost 96 and 89 games).\\n\\n  Gerald, look at what happened to the Stars; they are off to Dallas.\\n\\n\\n\\nGerald, the Alberta election is slated fou 7 June, unless something RE?ALLY goes \\nwrong this time!!

This battle between the peole and Pocklington\\nstarted in 1986 and got WORST when Pocklington sold Gretzky.  \\n\\nThere were days when you can shake the hand of Pocklington when he was\\nrespectalbe( I use to do so in 1982 - 1983 season) , but those days are GOE!!\\n\\n\\nBTW, when following up, please delete name of posting writer.\\nThis leads me to believe that it\\'s not really a rabbitball year, and that\\nwe\\'ve just had a rash of high-scoring games.  I bet this one day\\'s worth\\nof games pulled everything back to close to average.\\n\\nInteresting, because the other day, all but three games had ten or more\\nruns scored, and yesterday no game had more than nine.\\nAfter a quick start, Pena has been stuck in a rut.

It was the Phils only win in the three game series, and\\nwas the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young\\nseason.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2\\nJohn Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However Danny\\nJackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead.\\nMitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4,\\nhowever Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  In\\nthe 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year\\nto push the Phils ahead to stay.  However, in a shaky bottom of the\\n11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when\\nthe Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of\\nposition players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the\\ngame.\\nPerish the thought...but you know, you may be right, at least as far\\nas MAJOR LEAGUE professional sports teams go.  They all seem to be\\nbecoming BIG MONEY games, much more so than at any previous time.  To\\nthink that if I am ever able to move back home several years from now,\\nall that may be there is an AHL team, at best...SIGH.If ESPN pisses you off, call them - they do respond to calls.

I\\'ll be surprised if he makes it through\\nthe next 2 weeks, unless drastic improvement is made.I\\'ve noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict\\nthe Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how?\\n\\nFirst Base:\\n\\nGrace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil\\nFielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations,\\nthen even, otherwise, edge to Cubs\\n\\nSecond Base:\\n\\nSandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge\\nto Cubs...a big edge.\\n\\nShortstop:\\n\\nVizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an\\nautomatic out at bat. Weiss isn\\'t much better with the stick. Even.\\n\\nThird Base:\\n\\nDave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter.\\nBuechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to\\nFlorida.\\n\\nCatcher: \\n\\nSantiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to\\nMarlins\\n\\nLeft Field:\\n\\nConine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential.\\nI watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves\\nhimself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position\\nwhere Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.\\n\\nCenter:\\n\\nScott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the\\nCubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May\\nisn\\'t Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays\\nfull time.\\n\\nRight:\\n\\nFelix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does\\nSosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs\\n\\nStarters:\\n\\nAquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won\\'t\\nremind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard\\nis average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs\\n\\nMiddle Relief:\\n\\nEven. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins.\\nCarpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.\\n\\nCloser:\\n\\nA healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but\\nno Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save.\\nLook for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with\\na better ERA) for Harvey.

The\\n\\treporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he\\n\\tgave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with\\n\\tthe fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that\\n\\tspeak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not\\n\\tthe) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac\\n\\tMcCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his\\n\\tbook, _All The Pretty Horses_.  Yet, few MLB organizations\\n\\temploy Spanish speaking personel, one of the exceptions being\\n\\tthe Oakland A\\'s.\\n\\n\\tAnother point:\\n\\n\\tNearly 90% of Latin American players have some African blood.\\n\\tYet, most report that they\\'d never really felt black until\\n\\tplaying ball in the US.\\n\\n  \\n\\tIronically enough, it is the early presence of Latin American\\n\\tbaseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea that\\n\\tbaseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson,\\n\\tas many \"light black\" or \"brown\", Latin Americans were\\n\\tincorporated into baseball. \\n\\n\\t/S\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, but\\n\\n\\t(a) we were talking about peak level, not career averages\\nand\\n\\t(b) Clemente was the best fielding RF of all time, as far\\n\\t    as anyone can tell\\n\\nI did a quick scan last night, looking for players with a peak comparable\\nto or better than Winfield.  In my quick-n-dirty subjective judgement, you\\ncould make good cases for Ruth, Aaron, Ott, Robinson, Clemente, Kaline, \\nMaris, Klein, Jackson, Waner, and probably a few others.  This is not a\\nknock on Winfield, but a comment on his consistency: all of those other\\nplayers had awesome stretches and very good stretches, while Winfield has\\nbeen more uniformly excellent.  Hall of Fame?  Absolutely.  Top-10 peak?\\nI\\'m not so sure.  Top 10 total career value?  Yes, almost certainly.\\n\\n\\nLocal to the Joe Louis Arena?

If\\nlast night\\'s game is any omen, the Isles could be on their way to that ole\\nchampionship form; COMING from behind late in a game. My advice to the Caps is\\nto pounce on those Healy Rebounds. Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the\\nlast period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury\\nsuffered at the hands of Dale Hunter. Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time for\\nthe playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an \\nItalian from the past; JOHN TONELLI!!! It was Tonelli who won a similar game\\nagainst the PENS in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. The Isles scored two late third\\nperiod goals to send the game into OT tied at 3. In OT, Tonelli scored the game\\nwinner to send the Isles to the next round. The Isles have lacked this tenacity\\nfor years, but perhaps its BACK!

Being a North Stars fan, it is sad to\\nsee all of the tradition of the last 26 years get thrown into oblivion\\nat the hands of a truly crappy owner.\\n\\nHopefully the NHL will install an expansion franchise in the Twin Cities\\nwithin the next five years.

Thanks!!!!1\\n\\n\\tK-->\\n-- \\nAnother word (offense) makes them my pick for last too.\\n(Well, there\\'s also my policy of never picking a Buck Rodgers\\' team for last)\\n\\n\\nThe 1961 Angels were  1/2 game out of 7th. The Athletics and \\nexpansion Senators finished tied for last. \\nThe 1962 Colt 45\\'s finshed 8th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last).\\nThe 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last).\\nThe 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).\\n\\nApparently being an expansion team with a poor A\\'s or Chicago \\nteam around is a `good thing\\'\\n\\n\\nThis may be an appropriate comparison.\\nThe 1929-31 Yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing \\n18, 16 and 13-1/2 games out of first. \\nIn 1933,\\'34 and \\'35 they also finished second ( though they were only\\n7, 7 and 3 games out).\\nEven great teams can lose - That\\'s why they play the season.\\n(on the other hand... I\\'m still picking the Braves to go all the way)Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter\\nof what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on\\nNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:\\n\\nCanadians: 400\\nAmericans: 100\\nEuropeans: 100\\n\\n   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top\\n25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.\\n\\n   Here\\'s the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick\\nof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let\\'s say, the\\nRed Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \"Bure\" \"Konstantinov\" and\\n\"Borshevshky\". Is this North America or isn\\'t it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,\\nand Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other\\nteams is getting worse as well. \\n\\n    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \"Pavel Bure, the\\nRussian Rocket\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see\\nthe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I\\'m not a\\nCanucks fan to begin with ;-). \\n\\n    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that\\nI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and\\nsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR\\nNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren\\'t even\\nbetter hockey players. It\\'s all hype. This \"European mystique\" is sickening,\\nbut until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue\\nto have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.\\n\\n    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly\\nonly getting worse.\\n\\n    I\\'m all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures\\nand Selannes of the world play on their own continent.\\n\\n    I just don\\'t want them on mine.\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n-- \\nRichard J.

(The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting\\nvs. non-clutch;  the Y-axis being the number of players.)  Certainly\\nthere would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell.  My\\n*supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently\\n(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might\\nbe able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players\\n(as opposed to all baseball players).\\n\\n  As a counterexample to \\n\\nYou won\\'t hear those kind of accusations from me.  It is interesting\\nthat you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also \\nlooked at.  He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA),\\nhitting in 1989 - 92  .217, .273, .250, .272    Admittedly, he has\\nbeen traded between leagues as well as clubs.  His clutch hitting \\nrecord is equally inconsistent.  So, for my purposes in 1993 I would\\nnot draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based\\non his prior performance.  I don\\'t know how I would have felt in 1988,\\nbut you may indeed be right.  \\n\\nWhen I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and\\na more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately\\nbelow his non-clutch BA.  Ditto for Joe Carter.\\n\\nThis probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having\\nwith others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical\\nhistory be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before\\nit has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply\\nstatistical analysis to selected components of the data base?\\n\\n\\n\\nI completely accept that reasoning.

me, so I can put these stats on the archive\\nsite.  Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer.\\n\\nHere are the individual goalie stats as of: Wed Apr 21 09:09:38 CST 1993\\n\\nThese stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date\\nlisted above.

Atlanta\\'s ABC has declined to pick up any\\nplayoff games till May9. And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16,\\nthey will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know this\\nis still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia, Alabama, etc., but\\nit is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate.\\n\\n\\nI asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating was\\nnot that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time\\nwithout much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon\\nis usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs.\\nShe told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golf\\nwas shown oin ABC, would contractual obligations come in the way. And how come\\ncontractual obligations didn\\'t come in the way of last week\\'s telecast? She\\nthen couldn\\'t give me a coherent answer.\\n\\n\\nAlso, I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game\\nattendances and that the demographics were good. I think ABC and other networks\\nshould begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with\\n thier sports programming.\\nI hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complain\\nbitterlyt about this. Tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts\\nsince they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation.------------------------- Original Article -------------------------\\nNewsgroups: rec.sport.baseball\\nPath: butch!netcomsv!netcom.com!csus.edu!wupost!uwm.edu!zaphod.mps.ohio-state.ed\\nFrom: scunning@louven.berkeley.edu (Sean Cunningham)\\nSubject: Candlestick\\nMessage-ID: <1993Apr21.041620.27894@pasteur.Berkeley.EDU>\\nSender: nntp@pasteur.Berkeley.EDU (NNTP Poster)\\nNntp-Posting-Host: louven.berkeley.edu\\nOrganization: University of California, Berkeley\\nDate: Wed, 21 Apr 1993 04:16:20 GMT\\nLines: 24\\n\\nHey folks,\\n\\nSaw the Giants play ball at the \\'Stick Saturday, April 17.  It was the game\\nwhere Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out,\\ntwo-run homer to right to win it.  (It wasn\\'t the game where the fans\\nthrew the give-away \"fotoballs\" onto the field in response to the homer --\\ntoo bad, huh?)\\n\\nWell, the \\'Stick is still cold.  The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it\\nwas cold then.  I can\\'t imagine night games in April at the \\'Stick.  The\\nwind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea.\\n\\nAt most games, there\\'s a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on\\nthe field a lot of the time.  I propose a Kid\\'s Clean-up Corps composed\\nmainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run\\nout on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smooths\\nthe infield) and grab the trash.\\n\\nIt might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have given\\nanything to be on the field with the ballplayers.  Everybody wins here!\\n\\nWhaddaya think?When I left, it was 4-3, Blues with 2:00 to go!  As I predicted in\\n\"@#$%! I was right in the first place!!!\"  Blues in 6!  YES!!!\\n\\nOf course it\\'s only one game -- that could be the \\'Hawks stab in the face to\\nwake them up -- that\\'s what playoffs are about, on any given day... :-)To make room for Harkey, the Cubs sent Shawn Boskie down to AAA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Good question!  I kind of wondered about this myself.  Just one\\nthought I had on it  -  the Babe himself was IN \"Pride of the\\nYankees\", which made me think\\n\\na) that version may be closer to the truth, and \\nb) the Babe must have been a pretty good gut to be in the movie even\\nthough some of the scenes didn\\'t make him look completely flattering.\\n\\n\\tI totally agree with each point you made.  Jose Viscaino looked\\nlike a single A hitter up there.  Who swings on 3-1 count with Maddux \\npitching and your teams down by a run, and you haven\\'t touched the ball all \\nday.  I also think too much is made of that lefty-righty thing.  Watching\\nthe Cubs games I get the feeling Steve Stone knows a lot more about what\\nthe Cubs should be doing than Lefebre does.  Harry said it best when he\\nstated after another terrible Vizcaino at bat-- we can\\'t wait til\\nSandberg returns!\\n  The roar at Michigan and Trumbull should be loader than ever this year.  With\\nMike Illitch at the head and Ernie Harwell back at the booth, the tiger bats\\nwill bang this summer.  Already they have scored 20 runs in two games and with\\nFielder, Tettleton, and Deer I think they can win the division.  No pitching!\\nBull!  Gully, Moore, Wells, and Krueger make up a decent staff that will keep\\nthe team into many games.  Then there is Henneman to close it out.  Watch out\\nBoston, Toronto, and Baltimore - the Motor City Kittys are back.\\nOne \"t\" in \"Eddie Mathews\"!\\nBecause a small advantage in fielding ability comes nowhere near\\nmaking up for the large difference in hitting.

The difference of .104 in OPS should be decreased by about\\n.025 to account for Wrigley, but a .079 difference is still considerable.\\nThe Thorn & Palmer ratings are\\n\\n           Adjusted      Adjusted    Stolen   Fielding  Total\\n           Production  Batting Runs Base Runs   Runs    Rating\\nSanto         123          284        -14       137      41.7\\nRobinson      105           52         -5       151      19.8 (26.3)\\nUsual disclaimers about T&P\\'s FR apply, but they really shouldn\\'t be\\nway off the mark in this comparison.  At least it\\'s better than fielding\\npercentage: Carney Lansford has a .966 , 10th best all-time, but -225 FR,\\ndead last of all time.  Also, since this total rating compares players\\nto league average instead of replacement level, Robinson should be\\nawarded an extra 6.5 or so for playing 653 more games.  He had a great\\ncareer, but I would prefer Santo\\'s plus 4 years of a replacement level 3Bman.\\n\\nBut I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack.\\nThat\\'s a similar story, Hack\\'s far better hitting outweighs Traynor\\'s\\nsuperior fielding.  Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be better\\nchoices (IMHO of course, though some recent net discussion supports\\nthis point of view.)\\n\\nShouldn\\'t that be right field?\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s not a cliche, and (unlike your comments below) it\\'s not a tautology.\\nIt needn\\'t have been true.  If every pitcher in baseball were essentially\\nthe same in quality (i.e. if the variance of pitching ability were much\\nsmaller than the variance of batting ability), then scoring runs would be\\nmuch more important than preventing them, simply because the *ability* to\\nactively prevent runs would be much weaker.\\n\\n\\nIf that\\'s your point, you should have said so.  What you in fact said was\\n\"Pitching and defense win championships\", and later \"Pitching is the essence\\nof baseball\".  Neither of which says what you are now claiming was \"your \\npoint\", and neither of which is true.\\n\\n\\nAnd you accuse Sherri of mouthing cliches!?\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s not clear to me at all that this is true.  In high-scoring games, the\\nteam with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time.  In low-\\nscoring games, the split is essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability.\\n\\n\\nI thought you said \"pitching and defense win championships\" and \"pitching is\\nthe essence of baseball\".\\n\\n\\n\\n   >\\n   >\\n   >>Jagr has a higher +/-, but Francis has had more points.

When\\n   >you add to that Jagr\\'s better +/- rating, I think it becomes evident\\n   >that Jagr had a better season- not that Francis had a bad one.\\n   >\\n\\n     Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to\\n     flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than\\n     Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of\\n     hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty\\n     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.\\n\\n     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice\\n     time per game and some measure of its \"quality\" (i.e., is the player put out\\n     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up\\n     against the other team\\'s top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would\\n     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious\\n     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.\\n\\nThank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the\\nfact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you\\nthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-\\ncomparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone\\nwould argue that Jagr\\'s higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\\nplay.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Francis\\'s low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team\\'s top center\\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can\\'t even get\\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\\n\\n(By the way, don\\'t get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy\\nfloater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like\\novertime of playoff games).\\n\\n\\tWhatta ass!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRoger, you should check your facts before posting! The Kings have \\nconceded 12 goals in 2 games. Greetings baseballers, \\n\\n\\tI have a choice of two more or less identical conferences to\\nattend, one in \\nDenver, and one in Dallas, both May 24-28. Could some kind Rockies\\nor Rangers \\n(they DO play in the Dallas area, right?) fans please let me know if\\nthere \\nare home dates for that week. I\\'d love to catch a game. \\n\\nAnd you know what?  There is no such method inherent in real life\\neither.  So I would assume you would endorse the notion that we \\ncannot state, with any level of objectivity, that Mother Theresa\\nhas accomplished more good in this world than Joseph Stalin.\\nAfter all, life on earth is a team effort.\\n\\n\\nHave you tried glasses?  I find them quite useful.  \\n\\nAfter all, there must be some reason you choose to ignore the mounds\\nof evidence we present.

And you know why?  Because I have\\nfull confidence that despite your protestations to the contrary,\\nyou are quite capable of using the knowledge we can come up\\nwith through statistical methods to boost your knowledge level.   \\n\\n\\nHave you tried calling a kettle black?\\n\\n\\nIn other words, in your world, you cannot objectively state that\\nJack Morris was more important to the Blue Jays than Al Leiter last\\nyear.\\n\\nIn your world, that may indeed be true.  Fortunately, in the world\\nthe rest of us occupy, it\\'s not.\\n\\nI hope you never serve on a jury, Roger.  I think the rest of the\\njury would have to kill you.  \"There\\'s no way I can objectively\\njudge the defendant to be innocent or guilty.  You see, there are\\n2 billion other people on this planet.  We have no way of knowing\\nwhether the defendant would have committed the crime if it wasn\\'t\\nfor all the other people on the planet.  We have no way of knowing\\nhow the defendant would have acted had he been on a different planet,\\nbecause living on this planet is a team effort.  And no individual\\ncommitts a crime totally isolated from his society; he is a part of\\nthat society.  That being case, anything I have to say on his\\nculpability would be absolute subjectivity, so I refuse to vote.\"I plan on being in the Toronto area sometime this summer (late June or\\nearly July) and would like to attend a Blue Jay game.

Ticket broker info for the Toronto area and/or ticket info\\ndirectly through the Blue Jays would be appreciated (I\\'ll bring oxygen\\nif need be.)  My schedule is flexible so any games are candidates\\n(though I\\'d prefer to see Texas.)\\n\\nThanks in advance.I was playing this golf game and something interesting happened.\\nOn the 7th hole, I drove the ball down the fairway, when the ball was\\nin mid-flight, the game completely froze. A couple seconds later, the\\nscreen went completely black, with an error message in large \"Bubble\"\\nletters that said DIVISION BY ZERO. I thought it was funny considering\\nI am a computer programmer, and I had never seen an error like this on\\nan actual video game system like Sega or Nintendo (or even Atari or\\nIntellevision years ago). Oh yeah, after the message, there was also\\nwhat must have been an address, in hexadecimal. I forget the exact hex\\ncode that was given. HAS THIS HAPPENED TO ANYONE ELSE??? It must have,\\nmy game shouldn\\'t have been the only one to do this.To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:\\n\\n  From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people \\nin the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. \\nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \\nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \\ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \\nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \\nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \\nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \\ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \\ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can\\'t remember his name) \\nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \\nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \\nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \\nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \\nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \\nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \\nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \\nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \\nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \\nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \\nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \\nwhich may happen.\\n\\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \\nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn\\'t \\nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \\nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \\nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see \\nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\\tSo, Minnesota may end up \\ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tGo Sabres!So what\\'s the deal with Bill Wirtz? Apparently, the Blackhawks - St.\\nLouis game was a standing room only sell out as usual, but the Hawks\\nreported the attendace as 16,199. Gee, I wonder if Wirtz is planning to\\nuse this as justification for continuing to keep home games off of TV?\\nWhat a schmuck.\\n\\nIn other TV news, the Penguins announced yesterday that they will have 3\\nfewer broadcast TV games, and will have 22(!) games on some sort of\\nsubscription / pay-per-view system. Yuck.     (Eric Roush) writes...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunny.  I didn\\'t realize Mr. Tanner brought up Bob Knepper v. Pam Postema\\nin the first place.  Thought it was someone named Jacobs.\\n\\n\\nWhy?  If a statement is truly idiotic, and is universally thought so,\\nthe challenge is a waste of panting.  Further, challenges that have\\nnothing (yes, nothing) to do with *baseball* are wasting others\\' time.\\n\\nYou got a problem with what Bob Knepper thinks?  Let\\'s hear it, in\\nsome sort of categorical manner.  (Actually, I question whether either\\nKnepper or Postema aren\\'t \"old news\" at this point, although what I\\nhave read of Postema\\'s book is interesting.)\\n\\n\\nI agree this far.\\n\\n\\nSez you.\\n\\n\\nThat does not come out in what you say down the road, here.\\n\\n\\nYo.  Even elementary school children have had access to our postings,\\nalbeit in an edited form.  You want them to hear you talk like this?\\nDon\\'t you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think\\nyou like to do the same?  Or do you want them to think you\\'re some \\npolitically correct demagogue who\\'s oh-so sensitive?  (Ho-hum.)\\n\\nPlus, you\\'re here limiting free speech to \"some obscure newsgroup that\\nI don\\'t read.\"  What BS.  You got a problem with what Jacobs says, what\\nKnepper thinks, all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas, more\\nand better speech.  Yours is the easy way out.\\n\\nAs for Knepper: ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about\\nany darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of\\nthem?  You know that often the best copy for the news is the one that isn\\'t\\npre-prepared.  They know Knepper has controversial ideas about women, they\\npop some question about Postema.  (An interesting related question would \\nbe whether the two ever appeared in the same game.  Off the top of my head,\\nI guess \"no.\"  If my guess is right, Knepper popped off about something that\\nhad nothing to do with him -- and Postema gets a book for it, and he doesn\\'t.)\\n\\n\\nNow, why didn\\'t *I* think of that?  :-)  :-)  :-)\\n\\nRGI missed the original post, but aren\\'t the Expos rushing alomost their\\nentire team this year?  I am from Montreal, and am a fan, but geez, the \\nExpos rank 27th in salary (only the Rockies trail) and someone at \\nthe average age would probably be in first year University!\\n\\t\\t\\tCorelMARK!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s the trouble: *what* peak years?  He wavers between excellent and\\nvery good, with no real bell-shaped pattern in there.  1979 was a fine\\nyear; 78 and 80 were merely really good.  With the Yankees, 84 (I think)\\nwas the best; that was the one with the .340 BA.  \\n\\nOf course, 1992 wasn\\'t bad, either.  He\\'s been in the bigs since 1973,\\nwith a one-year intermission for surgery.  Though he doesn\\'t have the\\nmix of skills that Pete Rose did, he\\'s like Pete Rose in one way: he\\'s \\nnot a natural hitter.  Winfield\\'s swing used to be the ugliest thing\\nin New York, and that includes the Gulf+Western Building.  But his sheer\\nathletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot.  \\n\\nFascinating player to watch, even now.  Not obviously great in any one\\nway; but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising\\nlevels.Well, I have compiled some statistics on the entries of my pool.

Are you out of your mind?!?!?  Good luck to you,\\nyou\\'ll need it!\\n\\nSo Pittsburgh is the consensus winner of the Stanley Cup.  They\\'ll\\nstatistically beat Detroit in 6 games.  HAHA  that\\'s happening!  NOT!  As\\nI said, every one of my picks will come true, and I picked Chicago to lose\\nto Pittsburgh in the finals, so tough luck to all you who picket Detroit.  \\nWell, tough luck to all of ya!

Did anyone see the ESPN feature on the Phils on Monday Night.  John Kruk had a great line.  He was talking about people on the team always playing and not sitting out because of a minor injury.  He said if they do they know we\\'ll kick their ass.  The \\ntime I saw in was in the afternoon and it was not bleeped.  When I saw it at\\nthey bleeped \"ass.\"  Mitch Williams talked about the team being a bunch of \\nthrowaways from other teams, and that is why they are so close.  Kruk said that\\nthey all get along this year.  Last year, he said, they hated the pitchers.  I \\nassume he was joking, but he always keeps a straight face when he talks.  Oh,\\nWhat a team!!!!!\\n\\nRob Koffler\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUm, what?  Eddie Murray was a superb first baseman for a *long* time.\\n\\nWinfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years, and excellently\\non several occasions.  \\n\\nDave Kingman\\'s *best* year was like Darryl Strawberry\\'s *typical*\\nyear with the Mets.  \\n\\nDarrell Evans, too, did a whole lot more than just hit homers, which \\n*is* all that Kong did.  \\n\\n\\n\\nWhom are you talking about?  Yes, Eddie Murray is marginal, but that\\'s\\nbecause he\\'s 38 years old.  He wasn\\'t marginal for a *long* time.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot.  \\n\\nSmith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better \\nthan anyone else ever has.\\n\\nYount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago, in case you hadn\\'t \\nnoticed.\\n\\nOne of his two MVP awards was as a centerfielder.\\n\\n\\n\\nLike whom?  There are many players in the Hall who aren\\'t anywhere near\\nas goos as the guys you\\'re running down.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s already the case, by some standards.  But the *bad* players in the \\nHall are all from the 20\\'s and 30\\'s.  Recent picks have generally been\\nexcellent.\\n\\n\\nNo, but who cares?  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth?\\nNot really.  But he obviously belongs there.\\n\\nThe Hall has generally had about the top 1% of major leaguers.  As \\nmore players come through the game, more will be in that top 1%.  \\n\\nAnd, yes, it\\'s pretty easy to argue that Smith,. Yount, Evans, Winfield,\\netc. are in the top 1%.  Dave Kingman on the other hand, was a liability\\nthroughout most of his career.\\n\\nOf course, Garvey *hasn\\'t* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don\\'t know\\nwhat you mean.  \\n\\nAs for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris\\'?  That\\'s what a lot of voters\\ntend to look at.  And Morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn\\'t\\nlead MLB history in walks allowed, either.Could some kind soul out there e-mail me the 411 on where I can find the mlb.c  \\nprogram?  I\\'m interested in some road trips this year....\\n\\n     Here is my traditional experience with tickets, playoffs and otherwise,\\nat the Civic Arena.\\n\\n     Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best \\nstrategy, given that you don\\'t mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E.\\nTaylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45,\\nwhen the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell\\nand will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.\\n\\n     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on; \\nwhat\\'s left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).\\n\\nOthers can add on their opinions as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe already got him under Pitchers, Overrated, Jewish.\\n\\n\\nProbably.  Is SHirley P still alive?  Just wondering.\\nAs long as the Yankees are in the same division the Red Sox will\\nplay better than .500 baseball.\\n\\nOr the Red Sox can hire former East German swimming coaches to\\n\"train\" them at the fine art of body \"building\". The Red Sox\\ncan use Chinese women swimmers as a reference.\\n\\nWith the \"HAWK\", the Red Sox definitely have a chance for the\\neast this year. He brings class, work ethic and leadership to\\nthe park each day. And he has a burning desire to play in the\\nWorld Series.\\n\\nFuture Hall-of-Famer, Andre Dawson will kick butt in Boston!\\n\\nfrom Rockies country,\\nThis is true, but the main thing the commish i.e. Selig needs to do\\nis to suspend Bobby Cox.  You *cannot* allow a team to come out at\\nthe ump as the Braves did.  I usually rip umps, but in this case,\\nthe players were dead wrong.  Cox should go for 5 games.  If I\\nhad ever umped a game where that happened, I\\'d have ejected every\\nplayer that came out.  Only Cox and Gant would have been spared, and\\nthen Cox would have gone in the ensuing argument.\\n\\n\\n\\nGood comeback, Rog.

A truly great GM would\\nhave been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon\\nof the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can\\nmaintain the team\\'s success but can\\'t push them to the next level.\\n\\nIn the history of hockey there have been several better GM\\'s than Murray-\\nway too many to name.  Murray isn\\'t even the best GM in the league today.\\nHe fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher and\\nQuinn in my estimation.\\n\\nI can\\'t imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen\\nin hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM\\'s.\\nYou obviously don\\'t understand how TV scheduling works.  ESPN had\\nprior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had\\ncontracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal\\nwas very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this\\none-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the\\nseason started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by\\nsqueezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota\\ngame) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball\\ntelecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last\\nnight).\\n\\nBut the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They\\nmust honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something\\nto do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of\\ncontract with baseball.\\n\\nSo relax.

They don \\' t have a real closer -- although Mike Stanton ( 4 saves ) has been used in that role . Didn \\' t Stanton start off great last year and then falter ? Despite this , your point is well taken . Atlanta doesn \\' t seem to have the same personality as a NY team , thus is unlikely to self - destruct . For Houston to take \\' em , Atlanta needs to suffer some injuries , particularly to their starting rotation . From what I understand , Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the club . Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of players .. Art Doug Jones is the key to Houston \\' s success . He must have another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West . lousey spring . Right ! A strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling bullpen . The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the club so far . Biggio and Finley just aren \\' t doing their job of getting on base . Instead of filling his role as an RBI man , Bagwell has had to assume Biggio and Finley \\' s job . Biggio concerns me , since he usually starts the season very strong . * * * * * * On a side note , are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning next year \\' s uniform ? There is talk that their road uniform will be ( blech ..) traditional grey , with the word \" HOUSTON \" written across the chest .

       " \": Hi there , : : I ' m german and I have been into this MLB stuff since almost one year now . : There are many problems occuring for me . One of them is the ERA statistic for : pitchers . What does it say ?? ERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game . Thus , if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned run , his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs , thus his ERA is 3 . 00 . To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9 . ERA = ( ER / IP ) * 9 An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error . More specifically , if an error occurs that represented the third out , all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs . Earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game . Here are some examples : If there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base . If an error occurs that represents the third out , all of the runs after this error and NOT counted as earned runs . If a pitcher issues some base on balls ( walks ), and leaves the game before the inning is completed , he is responsible for the people who were left on base . If the those runners who were left on base score , and the score was not a result of an error , those eraned runs are attributed to the pitcher who left the game . I hope this explains things for you .\",\n",

       " 'Mark Singer brings up the Strawberry Incident , where he lost a homerun and the fan caught it . Yes , I think he should have done more to get out of the way . As much as fans want to catch a ball , they really should be aware that winning the game is more important . As a Dodger fan , he has to be aware that this is the home stadium , and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible . As soon as the ball was hit that far , his first instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it , not to try to catch it himself , particularly when he is sitting that close . I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans , where they are against visiting team home runs so much , they actually throw them back on the field . Now , this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or not . Sure , he probably screwed up , but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win .',\n",

       " \"It was unlikely , improbable . For the Bruins , it was the stuff of nightmares ; for the Sabres , it was a taste of heaven . For the first time since 1983 , the Sabres have won the first three games of a series . Last time was a three games to none victory in a best of five against the Canadiens . It takes a little more work this time . The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work . On the heels of a shutout , one that took away Boston ' s home ice advantage , the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win . It wasn ' t easy . It wasn ' t always pretty . It still worked . John Blue got the nod for Boston , supplanting Andy Moog as starting goaltender . Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday . Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny , his fourth of the playoffs , on the powerplay , with Boston ' s Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box . LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists . Goal number two was Khmylev ' s first of the playoffs , a pretty goal scored when the Sabres stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev . Smehlik and Hannan assisted . Determined not to be shut out , Boston tallied on a shot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay , with Colin Patterson and Bob Sweeney both in the box . Period two was scoreless , a split of penalties between the two clubs . The third saw Boston ' s Smolinski get his first , courtesy of Oates . Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes later , from former Bruin Bob Sweeney ( Khmylev and Carney ). Neely tied the game 3 / 4 of the way through the third , sending it into overtime . Last year overtime meant a Bruin win . Last night , it spelled sweet revenge , as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box , on a tip in by Khmylev ( Hawerchuk and LaFontaine ) a minute into overtime . Both teams finished with 34 shots . Power - play conversions -- Boston 5 - 1 . Buffalo 7 - 2 . Referee -- Rob Shick . Comments : Shick pocketed the whistle in the third , allowing a lot of clutching and grabbing . Buffalo ' s penalty killing unit was fantastic again . Mogilny was checking . Granted he missed once and instead flung his body into the boards , but checking like this is a novel idea to Mogilny . The crowd was unbelievable . I don ' t think I ' ve ever heard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game ( remember , I was only five when they played for the cup . I don ' t remember it and no one took me to the games ). Doug Bodger , in a postgame interview , noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk , but the crowd was too loud , even though he was shouting . It didn ' t seem to matter , as most of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great . Yuri Khmylev didn ' t seem to realize that he was the game ' s third star and didn ' t skate out when his name was called . Sweeney ( 2 ) and Fuhr ( 1 ) each were out before Yuri made his appearance , sans jersey . When asked in an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was , he responed yes ( ok , it was through an interpreter and he said more than that , even more than the interpreter said , but I digress ). The interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn ' t speak English , he must not understand playoffs . Uh - huh .\",\n",

       " 'Note : I \\' m not posting this as part of an argument with Roger Meynard , but as an independent sort of thread . I do actually quote some things that Roger Meynard wrote , but it might be better to think of this as \" sampling \" his post ( in the hip - hop sense ) because it fits in with what I want to say . There \\' s an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some people \\' s conception of a biological organism . In the biology context , we would very likely read \" fitness \" for \" the score of the game \" and \" organisms \" for \" teams \". How we interpret \" players \" is trickier , but either \" organs \", or \" genes \" might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make . A \" genes \" interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case , but that would be a different and probably longer post . If , however , we take the \" organ \" view , then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like \" species X is more fit than species Y because of a better organ Z \". Given what we know about the interdependence of organs , we would often be suspicious of such claims . ( But note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map \" species X \" onto \\' humans \\', and \" organ Z \" onto \\' brain \\'). On the other hand , some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others , as far as we can test them ( e . g . \\' brain \\' above might be more reasonable than \\' pancreas \\' assuming no gross pathology , particularly if species Y is a primate ). Even when you make such statements , you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism , and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another . ( Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species .) However , if we are non - vitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak , we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable \" whole \" but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable . Some of these processes might be localized to particular organs , while others may be distributed across multiple organs . In a way , this is just like a baseball team , except that I think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are * much * simpler and less numerous than in most organisms . One thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do . But , of course , this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can , and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty . Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation , but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research . In this cases , we \\' re seeing the word \" statistics \" means \" summary of observed events \", where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process , and possibly inputs for other processes . Thus , if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism , data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses . This statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again . Fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment ; you might be fit in one situation and not another . Moving to baseball , it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league . In at least a nominal sense , the division winners are the fittest teams in the league , in that they ( on average ) had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts . But in a real sense , there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to ( or interesting for ) baseball . The same is true in biology . But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the World Series in basebal . In the world series , the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played , and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful . It might be fun to watch , but it \\' s unclear what it all really means . *** Now just one more un - related point : On the other hand , you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes , and maybe some of us ( e . g . me ) who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis . But this is probably only due to the fact that a 162 - game schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops aren \\' t the only difference between the winners and the losers . Moreover , you \\' ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World Series situation that makes the strong claim that * nobody * can predict the WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the well - known home vs . road effect on winning percentage . Since stats are summaries of events , it \\' s true that if you know the events you can derive the stats . But if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats , then the stats produce new knowledge , and some of this might even be reliable , repeatable , and useful . Speaking of which , I should get back to producing knowledge in a different field . That is , of course , if I can produce knowledge even though I \\' m relying on stats to do it .',\n",
       " 'Sigh . Here we go again . Must I ? If I were to say that batting average is a predictor that can be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a hit on a particular plate appearance , is that only valid if I can define the skill in hitting a baseball ? That \\' s all I \\' ve said , except I used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations . I did not say I could predict the future . I \\' ve suggested that the statistic is not necessarily meaningless . Here \\' s the data for this situation : Non - Clutch Clutch AB H BA AB H BA Sabo 1539 452 . 294 259 59 . 228 Samuel 1564 383 . 245 278 83 . 299 If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time , I assume you would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch - hitting Samuel . I \\' m sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance . You just wouldn \\' t have used this particular aspect of prior performance . Is this not correct ? One more time . I did * not * claim to be able to predict the future . I said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would have had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo . And I am not dismissing your work . I \\' m stating my opinion . You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid , so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work . I did not say that clutch - hitting is well defined . I said that the data is significant to me . I did not say that it is a consistent skill . I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances . And , [ big sigh ] I have NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT EVER called you or anyone else on r . s . b . \" stupid \". It is nice , however , to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceived biases . Ah . I knew we could get to the name calling . And there \\' s that word you like so much . Wait a minute . I thought I first had to define clutch hitting . Do I , or don \\' t I ? I made two statements in my post . 1 . I am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting . 2 . I would have hit for Sabo . As for # 2 , many of us make a number of written statements through this media about what we think will happen in baseball . I \\' m not shy about it . I \\' ll make the statement again . I believe that by season \\' s end that Chris Sabo \\' s batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in non - clutch situations . I can \\' t prove that it will happen , so I guess we \\' ll just have to wait and see . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Here \\' s another one for you . In 1989 - 1991 Joe Carter \\' s batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in non - clutch situations each year . I presume you think this is random . Non - Clutch : 1585 AB 411 H . 259 Clutch : 338 AB 68 H . 201 So what could we expect in 1992 from Mr . Carter ? Well , his composite BA through 1989 was . 268 ; through 1990 was . 262 ; through 1991 was . 263 , so I think we have a pretty good idea of what kind of batting average he can produce . In 1992 he hit . 264 . Not surprising , huh ? Also in 1992 : Non - Clutch : 536 AB 144 H . 269 Clutch : 86 AB 20 H . 233 No , this doesn \\' t prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of major league ballplayers . It just makes me think that in 1993 Joe Carter \\' s batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in non - clutch situations . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - As for # 1 ( above ), I have plenty of company . John Dewan of STATS , INC . is the editor of The Scouting Report wherein the statistics regarding clutch hitting are compiled , reported and referenced in the text . Bill James makes numerous references to a player \\' s ability to hit well in the clutch . I am not saying that I can predict the future any more than they are . You ( and others ) are saying that your work renders their statements ( and mine ) meaningless .

Seriously , what is he all about ? I know he was a coach at one time , and from the volume of posts about him , SOMEONE surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow , but my question is , what is the deal with him ? Secondly , are the comments of his that I read about on the net merely flame bait , or do people actually take him seriously ? I gotta tell you , from what I see , he really sounds like an ass .

Nobody was even vaguely interested . b ) Several other teams had made it known that they would grab Prince , who was out of options . c ) LaValliere ' s release had nothing to do with him being through . He was released , because , in the event of an injury to Slaught , LaValliere is no longer capable ( they believe ) of being the everyday catcher . Since Slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties , the offense should actually improve with this move .\",\n",

       " \"A lot of teams carry 3 catchers on their 25 man roster , but the 3rd catcher is seldom ever used . He is only insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher is injured during a game . So to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever , why not invoke a catcher re - substitution rule : If the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game , the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game . Given this rule , a team wouldn ' t need 3 roster catchers . The 3rd catcher could be playing in AAA or be a non - roster bullpen catcher .\",\n",

As the pitcher starts to throw home , the runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for the suicide squeeze . The pitcher , seeing this , does not throw home , but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down . It is the balk rule that prevents this from happening . Believe it or not , this actually happened to me once in an OBA ( Ontario Baseball association ) game in Milton , Ontario . I was the batter and to my amazement , the umpire missed it . In the 12 years that I played ball , this was worst piece of umpiring I ever saw .',\n",

       " 'I finally got it back , with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending it . # 2 ROB ZETTLER Season : 4th Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : C / C - Zettler gave the Sharks every bit he \\' s got this year ; unfortunately , this still wasn \\' t enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer , if that . He works hard , for sure , but is no better than average on defense , and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times , while being basically an offensive zero ( 0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games ). He would be hardpressed to make the team next year . # 3 DAVID WILLIAMS Season : 2nd Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , free agent from New Jersey Grade : C / C - IMO , Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in \\' 91 - 92 , playing a combination of good offense ( 3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games ) and good defense . But he , playing the first part of this season in Kansas City , was good neither offensively nor defensively this year ; it , then , appears that \\' 91 - 92 was a fluke . Although he improved towards the end of the season , he was prone to being out of position defensively , and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team \\' s leading scorer among defensemen last year . He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year . # 4 JAYSON MORE Season : 2nd Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , from Montreal in expansion draft Grade : B + After being touted as the team \\' s top defensive prospects in training camp before \\' 91 - 92 , More had a rather disappointing \\' 91 - 92 , as he was not particularly good defensively , and had just 17 points in 46 games . He , then , proceeded to improve his game massively this season , becoming the team \\' s most reliable defenseman , whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional ( but only occasional ) offensive flash . Offensively , he was even more disappointing than last year ( 11 points in 73 games ), but his defense improved tremendously . He is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman . # 5 NEIL WILKINSON Season : 4th Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : B - Wilkinson was probably the team \\' s top defensive defenseman in \\' 91 - 92 . However , partially because of injuries , he was not the same this year , as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries , and seemed to be slowed even when playing . He , then , had often to be saved by his defensive partners ; that is , if they are there at all . But he also had some solid games , and if he can be complete healthy , he can still be a force . # 6 SANDIS OZOLINSH Season : 1st Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , 2nd round pick in entry draft Grade : I ( A ) At the time of his injury ( December 30 , against the Philadelphia Flyers ), Ozolinsh was well on track to be , IMO , the team \\' s MVP . A serious knee injury in that game , though , forced him to miss the rest of the season ( 47 games ), but he still finished as the team \\' s top scorer among defensemen ( 23 points ), which , of course , tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from their defensemen , but it also tells of Ozolinsh \\' s abilities . At the time , he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense ; he was still susceptible to so - called \" rookie mistakes ,\" but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team , rookie or veteran . If he can come back from his injuries , he is ready to be a star . # 19 DOUG ZMOLEK Season : 1st Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : B Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year , being one of the only two Sharks to play in all 84 games of the season . He was solid on defense , but after being billed as an offensive defenseman , he didn \\' t show it ( 15 points ). He was also prone to penalties , and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team ; however , that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents , and he was at his best when playing physically . But to become a fixture in this league , he needs to improve both offensively and defensively , and cut down on the number of power - plays he gives to opponents .',\n",

Remember that feisty reporter that entered the New England Patriots locker room ? She started crying like a LITTLE GIRL ! I just don ' t think women belong in a man ' s sport . Before you smart guys flame me for this , I know the given example was about football . Who cares ? It still applies to other MALE sports . How can we have women umpires ? Jeez ! Look at Pam Postema . Just because she ' s a woman , everybody on the face of the earth thinks it ' s great that she ' s getting an opportunity to ump . If you even watched the games and had an IQ greater than that of roast beef , you ' d see that she is not nearly as good as most AAA umpires . Besides , she is probably more worried about cracking a fingernail with a foul tip off of Wade Boggs ' bat . Or Jose Oquendo ' s bat . Either way , there are too many complications .\",\n",

I ' m skeptical of the first , because I don ' t think Snow is that good a player , and he is on a losing team . I ' m skeptical of the second because of his back . Mattingly is 32 this year , and how many players play until they are 40 ? Not too many , and most of them didn ' t have chronic back problems when they were 32 . Could be wrong on either or both , but I think that ' s the smart way to bet ...\",\n",

       " 'Yes , a point well - taken ... however , even in areas that finally got some games , there \\' s something nagging in the back of your skull when the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its sports news , \" There \\' s an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City , and we \\' ll * try * to get you an update through the show ...\" when you know that it \\' s on a satellite \\' s feedhorn somewhere up there ... From today \\' s Times , ABC got great ratings in Chicago and St . Louis ( a 4 . 2 ), and the Kings - Flames got a 2 . 9 on the West Coast , but only a 2 . 2 in metro New York ( i . e ., the Devils squandered their newfound support from a year ago when they played the Rangers )-;). In comparison , Seniors Golf did better ... I fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great ... I can \\' t tell if ABC did any advance marketing or not , \\' cos I don \\' t watch much TV ... the NHL should have made sure that it was solid on cable before going on the air . Even ESPN could \\' ve sold second rights to third party systems ( i . e ., non - SportsChannel ) since they are not making any extra money by sitting on the games ... hockey fans will not necessarily be watching pre - season beach volleyball if playoffs games aren \\' t being shown somewhere ... gld',\n",
       " 'Well put , Jason . I am not from Wisconsin , but I have close relatives who live in Port Washington ( about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee ), I visit the city regularly , and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals play and the NCAA Hockey Championships . It is a beautiful building . The Pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in North America . As to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a franchise , word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown County Arena . Once again , the Admirals are an independent franchise , and the people of Milwaukee have been supporting them well . The games I have been to have seen crowds anywhere from 10 , 000 to 13 , 000 , which are numbers some NHL teams ( i . e . the Islanders , Hartford , New Jersey ) would be envious of having on some nights . Plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without the glamour of having an NHL club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount of hockey interest exists in the city .

Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect examples of players that real fans know aren ' t worth a damn and yet , being benificiaries of marketing - oriented coaching strategies , have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer , the very fans the NHL wants to attract , that these players are indeed superstars .

Percentages , as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative .

       " 'Oh , yeah . Dave Winfield -- marginal player . Guy didn \\' t hit a lick , had negligible power , was a crap fielder and had no staying power . Dave Winfield , now entering his ( I believe ) 20th big league season , is still a damn decent hitter . Admittedly , his defense has slipped a great deal , but in his prime , he had a powerful arm and great range . Take a look at the stats : I don \\' t know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players . Kingman was a one - dimension power hitter -- he couldn \\' t field , he ran like an anvil , hit for a low average ( though , if I remember right , his OBP wasn \\' t THAT hideous ...), and ( for those who consider such things important ) was a absolute - primo - dick . Eddie Murray ? Yup , only the best 1st baseman of the 80 \\' s . I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots , but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983 , it seems that he wasn \\' t overrated by the media . Lee Smith ? Hmmmm ... This one \\' s actually pretty close . He \\' s had a s solid , dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks ( Wrigley , Fenway ...). I \\' d have to take a closer look at the stats ( it \\' s been a while ), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber . You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers , simply racking up a lot of saves doesn \\' t mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch , too . Simply because Minnesota and Boston and ( for a month ) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one , the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves . No way should HomerMan be in the HOF , IMHO . Darrell Evans ? Nice career , actually a bit underrated ( kinda like Ted Simmons , IMHO ), but not a HOF \\' er . Lemme ask you this . Who the hell playing the game ISN \\' T marginal ? Now , wait a goddamn minute here . Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop . His defense was SO good that he \\' s won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves . Again , Gold Gloves are mediot - biased , and a good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie \\' s more recent awards , but usually , this is tempered by someone else in the early 80 \\' s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career . Ozzie \\' s offense , you ask ? Good OBP , great speed numbers , in a park which , for most of his career , depressed offense , admittedly , no power (\\' cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still , a definite asset offensively . Yount ? 3 , 000 hits , MVP at two different positions , uh - huh , a real stiff . His \\' 82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory , and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks , as far as SS numbers go . He \\' s a clear HOF \\' er , IMHO . Well , as far as Garvey goes , you \\' re right . Garvey is a \" mediot \" candidate , pushed because of his \" winning attitude \" ( a minor factor , if one at all ), and his \" great defense \" ( no errors , admittedly , but the range of a tree stump ...). Garvey shouldn \\' t be in the HOF . SkyJack ? I \\' ve said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so , but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris \\' \" ability to win \" which is nothing more than Morris \\' \" ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs \". At this point , Morris is an average pitcher ( although from his early returns in \\' 93 , he may be damned close to done .). But , in all fairness , Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80 \\' s for up - and - down Tiger teams . While 1984 was ( obviously ) a great year for Detroit , the rest of the decade , the team was generally in contention , but not favorites . Morris \\' career numbers are quite good , and worthy of HOF \" consideration \". Ryan ? Of course , but be careful . I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about \" Yount and Smith being shortstops who hung around a long time \". After all , Nolan never won a Cy ... Damn , he \\' s just pitcher who hung around for 99 years ... His W - L record is mediocre ... ( Of course , Nolan \\' s a HOF \\' er ...) Puck ? Probably , although he \\' s got to play reasonably well for a few more years ( 10 years , even good ones , aren \\' t enough to make the HOF , most likely ). That said , I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF , pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out ( barring something REALLY tragic or sudden ). He \\' s very popular in the media and with fans , and legitimately has been one of the best CF \\' s in the game since he joined the league . I \\' ve always liked the guy , and I hope he does make it . And , in the end , I think the Puck will make it in . But , really , it \\' s too early to sell . This debate comes up rather frequently on the net , and , believe it or not , I never tire of it . It \\' s an interesting subject . Here \\' s an off the top of my head list of potential HOF \\' ers from each team . I probably left a couple of guys off , so feel free to follow up . I won \\' t consider ANYONE who started playing after about 1985 ( again , too early to tell .)

       " \"The mission to revive hockey at UMass is now underway . At the 4 PM Saturday afternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena - former Boston College Asst . Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year , $ 85 , 000 / year contract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen . Mallen was the third viable pick for the position , right behind Jeff Jackson ( Lake Superior ) and second behind Shawn Walsh ( UMaine ). Previous offers for the position were rumored to have been offered to the asst . coaches of Brown , RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians . UMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had undermined the team ' s position over a period of years . In late November of last year , the $ 52 million Mullins Sports Center was opened following its one year construction deadline . The Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div II / Div III schedule this upcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 1994 season . Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or potential team candidates for the Minutemen - it is expected that he will leverage off his inside contacts within New England , the Bay State and Europe to draw on competitive , top ice players for the University . UMass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester ; expect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources . .... J .

Eklund has never had a point a game season in his career , his production is very typical for him . How does he qualify as a disappointment ? If anything he ' s a surprise . My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players , but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a # 1 goalie . My biggest disappointment is Bill Dineen .

       " \"The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their quest for more left - handed pitching . So far , no takers . Personally , I think Harris is a defensive liability , and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays , or at least been among the leaders . Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day , he can get the job done . If Sharpy played just one base every day , say third , he ' d also improve defensively . Wallach has helped tremendously on defense , as has Reed . The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff . Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays . Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years . Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances . The Dodgers are turning double plays , and keeping more balls in the infield than last year . And Piazza has also been great on defense . He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first . Wallach , clearly , has contributed to the over all improvement on defense . But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs . But I don ' t think he is as bad as his current average . I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw seem to have come out of theirs .\",\n",

Do you think , by chance , that Don Cherry is a classy individual ? The money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on , and that is : \" it is the players that are what make the game great and not the people who put them on the ice \" Exactly true .

IMO , this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the other expansion drafts had , since the talent was diluted over both leagues . In Gammons ' defense , because the talent drain came from the AL as well , some increase will be seen . He also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump in offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season . He ' s still full of it ...\",\n",

The bottom four teams last year were essentially tied . Boston , in seventh place , had 73 wins . The Yankees and Indians , tied for fourth place , had 76 wins . Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than the Indians or Tigers . Basically , the Red Sox are stronger this year at 1B , DH , SS , LF , and RF . They have healthier starting pitchers ( so far , at least ) and better relievers . I see no reason why they shouldn ' t win ~ 85 games . Meanwhile , the Indians are in shambles and the Tigers * still * have no pitching . They will win some 20 - 3 blowouts , but they will lose an awful lot of 7 - 5 games too . * MAYBE * the Sox will play poorly , win 78 games , and finish fifth .

       " \"But , Gary , for certain sofa tubers like myself , this is an advantage . I can watch the Pirates on KBL , the Mets on WWOR , the Braves on TBS , and the mediots on ESPN at the same time , without missing anything . ( If something impressive happens , I ' ll catch the replay :-) ). So , I see ( essentially ) 4 games in 3 hours , instead of 1 game in 2 hours . What a deal ! ( Insert smileys as desired ...)\",\n",
       " \": : Of course , penalties will have to be changed : : : Roughing : Chauvanistic Males Being Aggressive : Slashing : Chauvanistic Males Venting Frustration : Fighting : Proof That Males Cannot Cope With Their Feelings : NO NO NO ! since all the penalties fall into three classes , there should only be three penalties : 1 . Foul ( Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your body or stick ). If you get 5 you are out for the game . 2 . Unsportsmanlike contact . ( An intentional foul ). This inlcludes all the current flavours of roughing , fighting and boarding . If you get two you are thrown out of the game , and fined . 3 . Technical foul . Bad mouthing the ref , by player or coach . Penalty shot is awarded . Two and you are thrown out of the game . Besides the penalty shot for one technical , if the team gets 5 penalties in a period , the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one , until the end of the period . The victim gets two shots if he / she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured . This works well for several reasons . First , penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey , right ? So , it follows that the more the better . Next , when the player is setting up for a penalty shot , the network can take a commercial . Finally , with only three penalties , the network announcers ( Don Meredith , Dick Vitale , John Madden , Pat Summerall , and Marv Levy , among others ) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the PA announcer says it . Oh , one other rule . When a goal is scored ( 10 - 20 times a period ), the play cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it . This way , the network can sneak in a few more commercials . Then , once the PA announcer has told them who scored , the TV announcer can tell you the viewer , and even have a chance of pronouncing his name right . Seriously , though , I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week , for the first time in my life . I was amazed how boring it was . The play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free - throw shooting contests DURING THE PERIOD !. Of course the ' Laker Girls ' get to do their routines at least 6 - 8 times during the game , and not just between periods either . There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average , maybe less . The game is 48 minutes , with 2 minutes between quarters 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 and a 10 minute halftime , and it still takes over 2 hours . The reason for this has to be TV . There is plenty of room to throw in commercials , and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening . On TV , basketball is fairly entertaining , IMHO . But , it is better to watch it on TV than to be there . If this is the road the NHL is following , then it truly is a sad day . Enough for now .\",\n",

       " \"During the first three games of the Pens - Devils series , I have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens . Jagr , MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch . But , one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman . Despite Brooks ' lunatic comments , and despite the Devils ' line changing adantage in last night ' s game , Bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the Devils in the dark . Granted , the hell - dwellers had the Pens bottled up for a while last night , but Bowman was eventually able to configure his line - up to get the job done . His ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible . Bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis . Last night , for instance , he realized that the speed of Jagr , Straka , and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance . As a result , Straka received many more shifts than average ; Jagr played almost the entire game ( he was always on the puck ), and MacEachern scored a goal , while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night . His ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is commendable , especially when a coach of such a talented team might simply rely on the overall talent to dominate , and to bring about success .\",\n",

       " 'Hey American Hockey fans , As a hockey fan I can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel . The problem is that other Americans don \\' t give a shit about hockey . They view it as a bunch of Canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in two - thirds of the US to see the stuff naturally . On the other hand BASEBALL is the * gasp ** swoon ** sigh * \" NATIONAL PASTTIME \". BASEBALL is so romanticized in the US that you are supposed to forget that other sport exist after April 1 and before November 1 . I feel that since ESPN shows 5 + BASEBALL games a week they should be able to show an OT hockey game instead of the opening innings of a BASEBALL game . Hell , the game is going to last 2hrs 45mins , so what if you miss the first 1 1 / 2 hrs ? And I am an Indians fan ! Show the end of what you started , then switch !

       " '[ stuff deleted ...] As I recall , the author of the _original_ article that started the thread claimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons . Roger , on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a \" jingoistic rant \", but you also supported the name - changing on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent . FWIW , I do not think the flaming was warranted , nor do I think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all . Just an observation ... However , that aside , the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it ( making it easier for the \\' casual fan \\'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour . IMO , the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports . In addition , I do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey , so it \\' s a pointless exercise anyway . If the current names are inappropriate , then that is a separate issue , not central to the original article . Something to consider additionally is whether or not players like Orr who \\' contributed to the glory of the sport \\' would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to play in . In this case , honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken - and - egg type question . ( although it was the chicken .....)

Speaking of Chelios , I wonder if Serge Savard feels like a moron for making that trade . I also wish we still had Corson . Rob Ramage on the ice is less useful than a Gatorade bottle on the bench . Vincent Damphousse has decided to take a vacation , apparently . I have no idea why Demers is playing Denis Savard on the checking line with Carbonneau . Savard is skating well , and is one of the only dangerous Canadiens in Quebec \\' s zone with the puck . Too bad nobody is in front most of the time . Do you also notice that in the defensive zone , not a single Nordique gets knocked down ? It \\' s disgusting . We also have Lebeau ( 5 \\' 10 \", 172 ) getting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn ( 6 \\' 3 \", 205 ) with no reply from the team , except to yell for a penalty . Dammit , Denis Savard threw the best ( only ?) Montreal hit of the night when he knocked Sundin off - balance . When Denis Savard is your team \\' s enforcer , there \\' s big trouble someplace ... Aside from that second goal , Roy did stand on his head . The third period at least provided something to look forward to . Habs won the period , IMO , and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game had started at 7 : 30 .

According to Gammons , advanced scouts are reporting that Morris ' fastball and slider still have the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability to keep the ball hidden during his release . Guzman and Stottlemyre have gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a little work with the pitching coach . Gammons looks to see Morris back in top form within the month . I , on the other hand , still have my doubts . Morris ' ERA last year was rather high for a pitcher who won 20 games . His showing in the Series was not surprising . Although I ' m not convinced that he ' s washed up , I have my doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the Twins in ' 91 .\",\n",

People see the batting average and the HR , but they don ' t really know their value is worth unless they ' ve studied the issue closely .

       " 'Another pair of suggestions : 1 . Remove the Balk rule . It is the runners responsibility to stay \" safe \" no matter what the pitcher does . 2 . If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time ( X = 3 to 5 ) without successfully picking off the runner , the runner advances a base as if walked . This last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases considerably . Suppose the pitcher uses up ( N - 1 ) of his N pick - off attempts . The runner can probably stretch his lead off the base , given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it right this time .

At the time , the mayor was optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality . Has there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream ? I know the city of Philadelphia has other projects ahead , such as the new convention center and the upcoming Spectrum II . But it would be nice to see this a reality .

       " \"The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory , a 5 - 4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers . The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich , just his 5th of the season and his first game winner . The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game . For the Whalers , the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season . Roster move : Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill Injuries : Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4 / 15 and was scratched . Lines : Eklund - Lindros - Recchi Beranek - Brind ' Amour - Dineen Lomakin - Butsayev - Conroy Faust - Acton - Brown Galley - Bowen Yushkevich - Hawgood Carkner - Hynes Dominic Roussel Game Summary : I didn ' t get TV coverage of the game , and since it was stormy in these parts I didn ' t have the best radio coverage either . Here ' s the box score followed by a few things I did pick up : First Period : Hartford , Nylander 10 , 8 : 51 Philadelphia , Recchi 53 ( Lindros , Brind ' Amour ), 19 : 59 . 8 ( pp ) Penalties - Verbeek , Har ( holding ), : 55 ; Carkner , Phi ( roughing ), 13 : 53 ; Houda , Har ( interference ) 18 : 43 Second Period : Hartford , Burt 6 ( Cunneyworth , Kron ), 2 : 00 Philadelphia , Bowen 1 ( Eklund , Recchi ), 7 : 09 Hartford , Nylander 11 ( Zalapski , Sanderson ), 9 : 38 Penalties - Galley , Phi , major - game misconduct ( spearing ) : 58 ; Verbeek , Har major - game misconduct ( spearing ), : 58 ; Brown , Phi ( tripping ), 3 : 22 ; Zalapski , Har ( tripping ), 15 : 51 ; Brind ' Amour , Phi ( slashing ), 19 : 50 Third Period : Hartford , Kron 14 ( Sanderson , Cassels ), 1 : 24 ( pp ) Philadelphia , Beranek 15 ( Lomakin , Yushkevich ), 3 : 11 Philadelphia , Faust 2 ( Brind ' Amour , Roussel ), 3 : 38 Penalties - Houda , Har ( tripping ), 4 : 20 ; Hawgood , Phi ( holding ), 5 : 30 Overtime : Philadelphia , Yushkevich 5 ( Faust ), 1 : 15 . Penalties - None Power Play : Philadelphia 1 of 4 , Hartford 1 of 4 Goalies : Philadelphia , Roussel 14 - 11 - 5 ( 30 shots - 26 saves ) Hartford , Lenarduzzi , 1 - 1 - 1 ( 38 - 33 ) On the first Hartford goal , Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off . The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros . The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net , got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie . On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in . This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense . Take the body , and if they get one shot and beat you fine . Don ' t give them another chance . Carkner , Galley and McGill are all terrible about this , I ' ll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play . That ' s all I have , my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored , much less how . From what I heard , Roussel had a very strong game . After the game , Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game . It was Garry Galley # 3 for his career high point total ( I ' m surprised that a former goalie wouldn ' t look closer at his defensive play ), Tommy Soderstrom # 2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1 / 2 a season and , Mark Recchi # 1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark . But here ' s the odd part . He couldn ' t decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1 . If he picks Recchi as # 1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros , doesn ' t that make Lindros # 2 ???? What ? You wanna know my three stars of the season ? Well , since you asked ... # 1 Eric Lindros . Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice . The difference between the team ' s record with him and without him is no accident . I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi . There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it , and I think that he will deservedly wear the ' C ' on his jersey next season . # 2 Tommy Soderstrom . 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour , and Tommy didn ' t have a Chris Chelios ( booo ) in front of him . He also didn ' t play a complete season due to heart problems ( sentimental edge here , my family has a history of heart problems ). There ' s no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future , and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years . # 3 Mark Recchi . Again , you can ' t argue with an all - time team high single season scoring mark . There are an awful lot of teams that didn ' t have a single player get as many points . Plus , Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season . Not a tough choice . Honorable mentions : Rod Brind ' Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year . The difference was that he wasn ' t on the top line this year and didn ' t get as much playing time . Then again , he didn ' t get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either . Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman . Yes , he made rookie mistakes , but he was usually fast enough to make up for them . I have a feeling that with his shot he ' ll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone , and I suspect that he ' ll be the teams top defenseman in years to come . Garry Galley was the team ' s point leader from defensemen . Again , there are some things you just can ' t argue with . And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome , he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game , and that was against his wishes under doctors orders . But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution . A little more caution , and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year . Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total . But consistency became a problem for him .

They finished 17th overall , will draft 10th in next years entry draft ( Quebec had the 1st rounder , though ). They scored as many goals as they allowed , 319 . The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985 . I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them , since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them . I hope you ' ve all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have . Knowing the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time almost bearable .

       " 'I can understand your anger about the German audience . I mean , it was the Finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous penalties the Canadien ref called in the last period . The Germans got a match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and seconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for \" delay of game \" for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd . The resulting 5 : 3 skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point , when the Germans were starting to come up strong . I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events . If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not able to play for minutes , because the crowd is so obnoxious . But I have to admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most other countries ( you should go to the US and watch the way they present the Olympics on television ; or the soccer crowds in England ; or the Finnish spectators at nordic skiing events .....). I mean it makes me sick to see all this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best team / player win and get cheared at . I do not mind if my favorite team looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to admit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team to watch ( the German soccer team is boring to watch , for example ). But , reading the above posting , I think that you are on the same level as these crowds you are criticizing . It is easy to talk of ( nearly all ) Germans as Nazis and nationalists ; thats the kind of propaganda that all ultraconservative people use against Germany . It is true that there is a great danger of re - arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience most of the people ( at least of the people that i know ) also regard this as a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now . Why can \\' t we just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers corresponding to their nationality ( eg . all Russians are Communists ; all Americans are Capitalists ; all Germans are Nazis , all Fins are hanging around beeing drunk on ferries ...). In my opinion , your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you don \\' t seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about . Thomas',\n",

Jorgenson did nothing exceptional that I noticed . Leius missed a ball I * think * Gagne would have reached ; we will certainly miss Gag ' s glove this season . He looked pretty good there . Contrary to what the mediots have been saying , he looked reasonable at first . He isn ' t mid - 80s Hrbek , but then neither is the Pretty Big Guy himself any more ( note : I ' m used to seeing the Twins 1B looking kinda big on the field , but not that big !). If he hits vaguely like last year , he ' s a perfectly good first baseman . Note : Much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings . Winfield may have big holes in his defensive game that didn ' t show up ( he didn ' t have to pick any bad throws , for example ), but I ' ll take what I saw so far .\",\n",

       " 'My votes ( FWIW ): Team MVP : Pat Verbeek . He fans on 25 % of goal mouth feeds , but he still has 36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary ( sp ?) team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons . Honorable mention : Nick Kypreos and Mark Janssens . Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP , but Kypreos ( 17 goals , 320 + PIM ) has been the hardest working player on the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker . I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value . Biggest surprise : Geoff Sanderson . He had 13 goals and 31 points last season as a center , then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80 + points . He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals , most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle , his garden spot . Honorable mention : Andrew Cassels and Terry Yake . The kiddie quartet of Sanderson , Poulin , Nylander , and Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention , but Cassels is just 23 and will score close to 90 points this season . He has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson . Yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put up about 20 goals and 50 points this season . Yake , like Sanderson , started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing , although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the right side . Biggest disappointment : Hands down , John Cullen . Cullen had a disasterous 77 point season last year , his first full season after The Trade . Cullen started the season off of summer back surgery , and fell flat on his face ( appropriate , since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass , and whining about it ). Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games , was a clubhouse malcontent , commanded the powerplay to a 9 % success percentage (> 21 % with Sanderson ), and sulked his way out of town . Worst of all , his 4 year , $ 4M contract had three years left to run , so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the Maple Leafs offered to Hartford . Honorable mention : Steve Konroyd , also subpar after signing a 3 year , $ 2 . 1M contract ; Eric Weinrich , who showed flashes of competence , but overall has played poorly ; Jim McKenzie , who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now ; and Frank Pietrangelo , who only seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row .',\n",
       " \"Let ' s start over . I ' m not arguing about who is the better goaltender . I ' d take Soderstrom right now . What I am saying is that Roussel can be a # 1 netminder . The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game ( less than that after last night ), their save percentages are close , and their records are similar . And with that , I just don ' t see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season . You say Soderstrom played against better competition . That may very well be , but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in those games . Besides , against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh , the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose . But I ' m not just judging Roussel on that game alone . I ' ve seen him play for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey . It ' s just my opinion , but I think he ' s got what it takes . Of course , I thought that about Mark LaForest , too . But I never did about Wendell Young . So I ' m batting . 500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall - era . As for the Rangers game , you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like . But Rou had his leg in position to make the save . If he didn ' t , it wouldn ' t have mattered if the Rangers player didn ' t get the puck up or not . It would have been a goal . On a breakaway that ' s what the goalie wants to do , take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him . I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two - time defending champs . And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the Habs . But you can ' t tell me that a Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it . Mistakes , both on offense and defense are part of the game . Or there ' d never be shutouts . Anyway , I ' m happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and I ' m not going to argue about it anymore . Besides , with the current 7 - game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year , I don ' t want to piss you off to the point that you don ' t sell me any tickets next season :-).\",\n",
       " \"[ Deletions ] Geez , Dal must have slipped something into Ted ' s drink sometime . Comparing Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable . Prince has never hit well in the minors and he ' s now 27 years old , I think . Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors . ( I ' ll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don ' t have another brain cramp and forget .) He had a very good year at Louisville before coming up to the majors . As I recall , the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit , decent fielding . When he got to the majors and didn ' t hit as well as expected ( not as much playing time ?), he became Exhibit 312 in Nichols ' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation as an outstanding defensive catcher . It ' s not clear he ever learned to hit . His four years with more than 100 AB -- Born 31 July 1962 Year AB BA SLG OBA 1988 195 . 282 . 320 . 328 1990 220 . 277 . 373 . 321 1991 459 . 264 . 351 . 317 1992 485 . 249 . 359 . 290 No power , less - than - league - average walks , peak year when he turned 28 , now declining . If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince , given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors , it ' s not a rosy picture . BTW , I ' m still unhappy with moving Zeile , who had the same reputation coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi , except that he was a much , much better hitter , to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well - above average hitter as an average ( or below average ) fielding catcher .

       " 'Oh , yea , and Chris Bosio pitched a NO - HITTER . One over the minimum , two bases on ball in the first inning , one runner left , 95 pitches . I listened to the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was a real treat ( as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite , I doubt if anyone is better than Niehaus -- but that Fairly guy is really annoying me ). But , I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching , it would have been a different story :-) Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest , best hitting team in Major League baseball .... Pretty impressive in any league . Man , if Johnson , Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a really interesting team to follow this year . Also , John Cummings ( rookie ) has had three solid outings with no support . If Fleming comes back this may be the best starting staff in the American League this year ( relief is another story , though - grimace ). Too cool . The first no - hitter that I have been able to follow from start to end . And again , I think Niehaus will win some kind of award for the way he called the game . The guy is truly a joy to listen to -- he deserves a pennant race ...',\n",

       " 'Apparently , Part 2 ( defensemen numbered 2 through 19 ) was lost when I posted it ; to make things worse , I lost my own copy . I have asked on the Sharks mailing list , on which it did get out , to see if someone can mail me a copy back . If someone responds , I will repost it when I get it ; otherwise , I will re - write it in a day or two and post it . Sorry about that . # 8 LARRY DEPALMA Season : 3rd Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , free agent from Minnesota Grade : I ( C -/ D +) No netter / fan watching the Sharks , including me , knows where DePalma was at the end of the season ; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights , but he wasn \\' t in San Jose , he wasn \\' t in Kansas City , and his name hasn \\' t appeared on the waiver wire . And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for DePalma . After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning , DePalma had an excellent week , scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense . Unfortunately , the 27 - year - old DePalma then disappeared the rest of the way , getting just 3 more points in 15 more games , and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice . He then was sent down to Kansas City , walked out from there , and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured ; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of Shark Bytes ( as the mailing list is now known to Sharks officials ) faithful , and neither the Sharks nor we miss him . # 10 JOHAN GARPENLOV Season : 3rd Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round pick in \\' 92 entry draft from Vancouver Grade : A / A - After an early slump , Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way , finishing with 66 points in 79 games , second highest total on the team , as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob Gaudreau . Kisio got most of the credit , but Garpenlov , finishing second in the MVP voting , clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills , as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders , getting a club - high 14 power - play goals . Contrary to his previous rep , Garpenlov also showed that despite his small size ( 5 \\' 11 \", 183 lbs .), he was willing to throw himself around when necessary , albeit not very successful yet . He also still needs to work on his defense , although he improved tremendously throughout the season , and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season . He will be a major key to the offense next year . # 15 DAVID BRUCE Season : 5th Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , from St . Louis in expansion draft Grade : I (?) After a banner \\' 91 - 92 , when he led the team in power - play goals ( 10 ) and was third in total scoring ( 38 points in 60 games ), Bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury , which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season . Of course , it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury , but the 28 - year - old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the Sharks \\' first season , and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well . The injury appears serious , which is a shame , because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now ; instead , his future with the Sharks next season appears clouded . # 18 MARK PEDERSON Season : 3rd Acquired : \\' 92 - 93 , trade with Philadelphia for C / LW Dave Snuggerud Grade : I ( B ) It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers \\' decision to unload Pederson , after a very good offensive season last season ( 40 points in 58 games ), but after riding the pine early in the season , Pederson was summarily sent to the Sharks in exchange of the defensive - minded Snuggerud , and he finished with 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks . He was also limited by injuries this season , and this limited his production ( 17 points ). But when healthy , Pederson appears impressive , with a good scoring touch , good size ( and the willingness to throw it around , although he \\' s not considered a physical forward ), and good speed . He also does not appear to be a liability on defense , but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much , exactly , Pederson can do . # 20 JOHN CARTER Season : 4th Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , free agent from Boston Grade : I ( B +/ B ) Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team , and the hard work worked wonders , as at times he looked great on ice . However , although he did look great at times , the fact that he received just 16 points ( in 55 games ) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do , and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about 20 games left in the season . Carter , who will turn 30 on May 6 , always hussled , but as a result , was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking , but he was generally a credit on the defensive end , but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity , and he did not impress offensively , although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties . He is very unlikely to be back next season . # 28 JEAN - FRANCOIS QUINTIN Season : 1st Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : I ( B +/ B ) I don \\' t understand why the Sharks didn \\' t let Quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season . He was generally hard - working and creating opportunities offensively , and appeared , at age 23 , ready for regular NHL duty , at least for a team like the Sharks , finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability . Shoulder injury in training camp before the \\' 91 - 92 season limited Quintin , the team \\' s leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two , to just 29 games with the Sharks and the Blades that season , but he looked impressive . He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season . # 41 MARK BEAUFAIT Season : 1st Acquired : 2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft Grade : I (?) After a all - star season at Kansas City , Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the Sharks decimated with injuries , playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only NHL point thus far . Despite small size ( 5 \\' 9 \", 165 lbs .), Beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary , and looked pretty good at times , although it \\' s too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games , in which he played mostly left wing , away from his center position at Northern Michigan and Kansas City . # 42 JAROSLAV OTEVREL Season : 1st Acquired : 8th round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade : I (?) Like Beaufait , Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea ( 7 games ) midway through the season . He was generally very much of a defensive liability , and did not show much offensively either , although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games . He may need another season to work on his defense , but once his defense is acceptable , he should be ready . # 44 MICHEL PICARD Season : 1st Acquired : \\' 92 - 93 , trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau Grade : I ( B -/ C +) The 23 - year - old Picard , although he perennially tore up the minors , seems to be close to being out of chances , for some reason , after being acquired by the Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games , scoring 4 goals for his only points , and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City . He was not particularly strong defensively , and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors , he has failed thus far to score in the NHL , although he has been given limited opportunities . He may be the Sharks \\' bait in the expansion draft . # 45 DODY WOOD Season : 1st Acquired : 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade : I ( D +/ D , although perhaps I shouldn \\' t give a grade at all ) I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much . :-) Then , it is probably no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far , although 13 games is a small example . He was generally a nonfactor on offense , was not particularly good defensively , and took too many silly penalties , losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games , projecting to to 446 (!) in an 84 - game season . He \\' s not ready , and needs at least another season at KC , where he can work on his fighting skills , if nothing else . His relatively small size ( 5 \\' 11 \", 181 lbs .) does not give much possibility that he can survive , at this stage , as an enforcer .',\n",
       " 'Actually , fired - coach George Kingston was a third of the GM triumvirate .

Can \\' t wait to see how the next season \\' s NHL Guide and Record Book lists the GM history of the Sharks . Given the depth of next year \\' s draft , the expansion draft rules , and the reputation of their GMs , Anaheim and Miami look pretty good as the first 90s expansion teams to win a Cup .

       " 'Philadelphia at Chicago : Teams tied for 1st after Sunday Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series . One Friday , one Saturday , and a good - old Sunday doubleheader . \" What could be better ,\" declared Ernie Banks . Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging ? \" It \\' s pitching , it \\' s always been pitching that we \\' ve lacked ,\" announced Ryne Sandberg . \" If we can get by Brewer , then beat Carlton , Alexander , or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we \\' ll know we might be able to win . \" Lord , I hope we pull it off .\" The Phils scored once in the top of the first ; Richie Ashburn singled , Pete Rose followed with a hit , sending Ashburn around second . Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center , and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks , who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third . Rose went to second on the play . Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center , moving Pete Rose to third . Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them . Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130 - 150 walks this year . Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well , and he lashed a double into a gap in right - center . \" Cool Papa \" Bell \\' s speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring . Nellie Fox was walked , and Bob Boone grounded out to second , ending the threat . \" Teams are starting to realize that you don \\' t have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti , and that is lowering their run total . It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen ( who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first ), and it \\' s a credit to the Phillies that they \\' ve been able to sustain their pace . The picthers have slumped at times .\" So came the analysis from Frank Chance . The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit , Thomas \\' grounder moved him to second , and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run . In the sixth , Ron Santo launched a two - run homer to make it 3 - 1 . Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth , as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third . Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox , but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit . Allen doubled to right , but luckily for the Cubs , Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense . He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third . Lance Parrish , hitting for Boone , was walked , and Bruce Sutter entered . Larry Bowa grounded into a 1 - 2 - 3 double play , but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch - hitter . Desiring a strikeout , since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch - running at third , Chance brought in Lee Smith , who induced a pop - up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder , ending the inning . The Cubs took the win , 3 - 2 , moving a game behind the Phillies . Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3 - Finger Brown Saturday . To get another righthander in the lineup , Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third . Unfortunately , Brown allowed six doubles , and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more , as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty . Madlock , batting sixth , had knocked two doubles of his own , driving home four runs . Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs , and Cuyler added another , and the score was 8 - 6 , Cubs after six innings . The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth , as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11 - 7 triumph . Sunday \\' s twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point , including a rare outside - the - park home run in the second game , off Robin Roberts . Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest , 4 - 2 , but the Cubs captured the second one 5 - 4 , with Waddell gaining the win . Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save , though he allowed one run in the eighth . The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co - leaders , and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday . ------------------------------------------------------------------- Montreal at St . Louis ( August 3 - 6 ): 3 - way tie for 1st Dennis Martinez is on a roll , and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday . The Expos have a wide variety of hitters , and - while they aren \\' t among the all - time greats , they are getting the job done . After winning their first first two games , they suddenly found themselves only 2 1 / 2 games out of first in this wacky season . Martinez triumphed 5 - 3 on Friday , and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3 - 2 Saturday . However , the Cardinals refused to give up , winning 6 - 2 on Sunday . The Cards captured Monday \\' s game , too , as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3 - 2 . \" We \\' re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed ,\" remarked Lou Brock . \" I don \\' t see why we can \\' t win this division .\" The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them . Two - thirds of the way through the season , there is a 3 - way tie for first . ------------------------------------------------------------------- New York at Pittsburgh ( August 3 - 6 ): 3 straight 3 - 2 wins for Bucs , now 2 back - but in 4th ! \" When your team is in a slump like we are , the worst thing is to play in a pitcher \\' s park like this ,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series . Keith Hernandez added that \" their defense takes away quite a few runs per year , and it must be giving them an extra 6 - 7 wins .\" The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season , 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers . Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All - Time teams . Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5 - 2 Friday , and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3 - 2 Saturday , in a game featuring some outstanding defense . When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6 - hit the Mets in another 3 - 2 win Sunday , the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the . 500 mark . They had been unable to several times in the past month . Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game . Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff , and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two - run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates . The Mets \\' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco , working his second inning , after Mookie Wilson pinch - ran for Gary Carter at second . With one out and a runner on first , Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch - hit . The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve , placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter . Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second . He slid hard into Honus Wagner , preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon . Tekulve allowed a hit , but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line , ending the inning . Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers , who entered to pitch the eighth , and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center , running through the stop sign at third to score an inside - the - park homer to win . The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3 - 2 wins , and had moved to within 2 games of first place , with seven weeks to go . ------------------------------------------------------------------ San Francisco at Boswaukta ( August 3 - 5 ): Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule , as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn \\' t tire . In fact , reported manager John McGraw , \" once this rough part of the schedule is over , maybe as early as this coming week , we may shift to a 4 - man rotation again for a little while .\" Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday , beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4 - 1 . Willie Mays had all four r . b . i . s on 3 hits . Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest . The Braves \\' park had been a homer haven , but this took the cake , as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16 - 13 . Willie Mays had three homers , Willie McCovey , Eddie Matthews , and Don Baylor had two , and Hank Aaron , Ernie Lombardi , Biz Mackey , and Mel Ott had one each . The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday \\' s doubleheader , putting them on a pace for 223 , which would be 4 short of the National League record . They were still a tad behind the \\' 61 Yankees \\' pace . They had allowed over 120 , though . Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth . He allowed only a run in the sixth , but faltered in the seventh . Joe McGinnity earned the save . In the doubleheader , the Braves \\' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game , but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won , 4 - 3 . The Giants took the second game , however , by a 6 - 2 score . The homer by Aaron was a magical # 150 by the Braves ; however , they fell to three game below . 500 , making a comeback extremely unlikely . ------------------------------------------------------------------- San Diego at Cincinnati ( Aug . 3 - 5 ): Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3 - game series , and the Padres felt rather good . With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game , the trade looked even better . McGriff \\' s batting average was even rising . Of course , the bench was very poor , and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield , but these were minor problems , since the pitching was holding up . Jones pitched a good game Friday , and won 6 - 3 . McGriff launched two home runs . Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday ; 5 - 4 was the final score . Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3 - 3 tie through eight innings before departing . The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth . Paige had departed after 10 , and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning . Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning , when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around . Thurm Munson doubled both runners home , and the Padres gamed a 5 - 3 win . The three - game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds . Though the Reds denied it , the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them . ------------------------------------------------------------------- Brookangeles at Houston ( August 3 - 5 ): Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome . The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game , opposite Don Drysdale . \" Normally ,\" Drysdale remarked , \" I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them . I can \\' t afford to with this team , though ; we have to get our own runners going ; we can \\' t Davis will get decked once .\" The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked , but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season . The hitting on this team is a little better , but the power is all doubles and triples . Still , Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend , as he threw two runners out trying for inside - the - park homers . For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros \\' park , they have a 23 - foot high gray wall all around the outfield ; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs . The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate , but the alleys are 400 feet away , with center field at 420 feet . \" It \\' s as if some three - year - old threw a tantrum and told his playmates : \\' If I can \\' t hit home runs , nobody will hit home runs \\',\" remarked Roy Campanella . The Dodgers stole five bases Friday , but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before ; for tonight , anyway , Davis , Jim Wynn , and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings , according to the manager . After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop , Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch . He responded with a two - run double , but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up , and the Astros didn \\' t score any more in that inning . They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3 - 2 deficit , and the Astros wound up winning 6 - 4 . They threatened to do even better the next game , as Tommy John would be their opponent . Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A . M . before the game . \" I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop ,\" he explained . \" How can we do that ,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered . \" They \\' re going to be beating the ball down , so we \\' ve got to be ready to throw on the run . Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt , but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws . We \\' ll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time .\" The plan almost worked . Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings , but the Astros got three ; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third . 3 - 2 Astros was the final , with Dave Smith earning another save . The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday , as Nolan Ryan walked five , three of whom scored in a 4 - 1 Dodger win . Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4 - 2 to Don Sutton , however , as the Dodgers \\' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough . \" We \\' re mostly a power team ,\" remarked Ron Cey . \" Jackie and , when he plays , Maury Wills are our only real speed demons , though a couple other plays can do it now and then . We \\' re sunk in a place like the Astrodome . I guess that \\' s why they \\' re so successful there .\" Indeed , it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome .

Here \\' s a very simele question to which I \\' m sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to . Please answer yes or no , Roger : Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs ? AL only , please . For anyone else following along , it is a well - known and demonstrable fact that a team \\' s win - loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows . It \\' s not a definite , hard - and - fast function , but there is definitely a correlation . In fact , as a rule of thumb , if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs , for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows , it will win another game . So , for instance , if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays , we find that they scored 780 runs and allowed 682 , of which Morris allowed 114 . All other things being equal , if Frank Viola , with his 3 . 44 ERA had replaced Jack Morris for the 240 . 2 innings Morris threw ( plausible , since Viola threw 238 for Boston ), the \" Red Jays \" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs , or enough for 1 - 2 more wins . Now , that doesn \\' t take into account that Viola pitched half his innings in Fenway , which is a harder park to pitch in ( particularly for a lefthander ) than Skydome . So , um , Roger . Unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores , could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis ? Clearly , it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would necessarily have put up a 3 . 44 if he had been on the Jay last year , but that is not the claim . We look at what the actual performances were and evaluate Viola \\' s as better than Morris \\' in the sense that \" had Morris performed as Viola did , his team would have been better off .\" This is true , but not so open that your brain falls out .

But the point of my * original * original post ( if not well stated ) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching abilities . Which leads to below : I think at this point there \\' s a personal , emotional element involved here which transcends Murray \\' s logical thought . As outsiders , it \\' s fine for us to say , \" He should hire a different coach .\" In fact , he has talked about doing so in the past . But , the press ( here in Detroit , at least ) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach , that I think he has taken it upon himself to prove to the world that he * is * capable of coaching a team past the second round . He needs to , as the papers say , \" get that monkey off his back .\" So it becomes a matter not of intelligence , but of pride . Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic ? Perhaps , but we \\' re all a little that way from time to time . I think eventually he \\' ll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties , and the team will improve as a result . I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work . In that sense , once he steps down as coach , we \\' ll see how good of a GM he really is .

       " 'Until six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL football . Last year I hardly watched a game . What turned me off were the incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game . A team scores . 2 . 5 minutes of commercials . Kickoff . 1 . 5 minutes of commercials . Three downs and a punt . 2 minutes of commercials . AAAAARRRRGH ! Earlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A \\' s , whom I believe institutionalize slow play . I don \\' t mind the cat - and - mouse game with Rickey on first ; in fact , I rather enjoy it . Similarly I would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first . What I object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first , or when the game is a blowout . I don \\' t mind when the pitcher steps off the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation , or when a hitter steps out of the box to regain his concentration . What I object to is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity . When a game is exciting , these little delays serve as tension builders and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game . When the delays happen with regularity , they become nuisances , just like the commercial breaks in football . I understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to \" speed up \" the games , basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move the markers and the ball to the spots faster . That did not address the problem of the continuity of the game . It may have appeased the sponsors and the networks , but I would be amazed if it did anything to enhance the experience of the fans . Similary , while some 3 - hour baseball games bore me to tears , those are the ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly long periods to get ready for each pitch . I doubt if anyone watching the Braves - Giants game cared about Gant stepping out . I doubt if anyone watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that was present . I would be totally opposed to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of baseball . On the other hand , I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful enough to sit down with Alderson / LaRussa / Duncan and explain that they are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games out the way that they do .

One of the umpires ? Add another one to the crew ? I ' m not sure I like this idea . I think it would severely diminish the number of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic ploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play ( one of my personal favorites ). Ahhh ! I suppose I should read the whole article before I hit the ' f ' key , eh ? Obviously , from what I wrote above , I like this idea . It may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag , since the pitcher knows he doesn ' t have very many chances to pick off the runner , so he may hurry too much . I ' d rather see runs scored as the result of sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness that could result from this kind of rule . So , I suppose there are some disadvantages to that idea too . I remember in little league , if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter ' s box , even for a moment , we were automatically out . That may be a little harsh for the majors , but seriously , how about putting a limit on the batters being able to step out , take several dozen practice swings , pound their shoes , scratch their balls , etc .?

The way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse , although Bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10 - 0 shutout of the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant . Bunning pitched a complete game six - hitter , striking out five and walking one . It would be inetersting to see , though , how the total innings for the year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league . Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1 through October 1 ; while they didn ' t play substantially more games than the other teams , the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch .\",\n",

       " \"The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to death , but I haven ' t seen anything in rsb yet . Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run . He stroked a line drive into the right field corner . The ball cleared the three - foot high fence and went into the crowd . Darryl , racing over from right center , got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence , but he missed the ball . A fan sitting in the front row , wearing a mitt , reached up and caught the ball . Home run . Now I ' ve seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball , and that the fan ' s glove was essentially behind Darryl ' s . Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry . What cannot be disputed , however , is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it ; he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing . He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch . That exuberance disappeared immediately , however , when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man . All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference , and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game . Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch . Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park , but then relented and just relocated him to another area . In an interview after the game , Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss . Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don ' t care about winning . L . A . Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch . Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play . Was the fan wrong ? Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference ? Or was he human and just reacting ? By the way , he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible . Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games . I question what he was doing in right center with a left - handed pull hitter up and the game on the line . Had he been closer to the play , he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball . But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan . -- The Beastmaster\",\n",

       " \"DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out of Moncton , the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind . The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from 20 - something to around a dozen ; and they wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise . Enter the Dallas Lone Stars . Dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise . Thus keeping the Hawks in the New Brunswick city . The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over 3000 . The Hawks only sold 1400 for this year .

With the emergence of the O ' s and the Yanks , it is far and away the best . While the N . L . West has the best team in baseball , and the Reds aren ' t bad either , they have nothing else . The Giants , Astros , and Padres all have talent , they do not have the all arounf teams that are found in the A . L . East . And the Dodgers just plain suck . As for the Rockies , who knows ? The A . L . East has the defending champs , and although they lost a lot to free agency , Toronto is still one of the best in baseball . The Orioles have the preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina , and you can never forget about Ripken . The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don ' t hurt to much either , although I always liked Bill Ripken .

       " \"There are several reasons for this difference . The main reason is that good hitters in their prime ( such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull ) are rarely regular DH ' s , even if they can ' t field ; it ' s more commonly a place to put aging veterans . Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly , getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field . I would expect such players to hit worse as DH ' s than they did during the rest of the season . A third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first or the outfield don ' t hit as well as DH ' s for some reason . Reggie Jackson was a good example ; in five years as a RF / DH for the Angels , he hit like the old Reggie when he was in right . The second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only ; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60 at DH will count only in the right fielders ' averages . This makes sense ; you might also look at it another way . Although the * average * offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left fielder , the * replacement - level * offensive performance is certainly lower ; if you are a left fielder but can ' t hit well enough to keep a job anywhere , then you certainly can ' t hit well enough to keep a job at DH .\",\n",

       " \"The Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as Vancouver outscored Winnipeg 3 - 2 . The pattern of the first game was repeated tonight , with the Canucks scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period , only to stave off a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent . The Jets looked more dangerous in this one but it didn ' t make a difference in the numbers that counted : goals . Vancouver ' s big line produced again , with centre Cliff Ronning and left winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to boost the Canucks to a 2 - 0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of Bautin and Ulanov . Mental lapses by the defence and goal - scoring talent in opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals . However , as in the first game , the Jets worked hard to take the game to the Canucks in the second period . The Jets dominated the second , checking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged by a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early . The hard work paid off late in the second , when Tie Domi caught Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make the score 2 - 1 . Domi ' s goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush to the Canuck ' s collapsing defence . The Canucks were unwilling to do anything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds . The Jets were allowed to set up and make plays . Both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably . McLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne while Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive . Selanne looked dangerous on the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck zone . The Canucks , on the other hand , looked like they were offering four checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead . A series of minor penalties at the end of the second period resulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third . The Jet ' s Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean ' s legs and into the net to tie the game at 2 - 2 . The Canuck ' s discordant play picked up where it left off . This was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected or were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight Winnipeg defence that were never supported . However , as in the first and second Canuck goals , a Jet defensive lapse ( re : bonehead play ) stalled the Winnipeg comeback . With the faceoff in the Winnipeg zone , Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with no Jet defender anywhere near him . Bure , who had been invisible in the game up to that point , took a rebound and managed to roof it with a backhand even though he was off balance . By then it was too late for the Jets to come back . Essensa made it to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing for their attack . Canucks 3 , Winnipeg 2 . Next game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games . - 30 -\",\n",
       " \"I suspect that splits such as these are the result of positioning . An outfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a lot of balls , preventing both singles and doubles , and also cut off more uncatchable balls , turinging doubles into singles . However , a fielder who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies ; this means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles . Has anyone seen these players ' positioning ? Do Butler and Felix play deep , and Lankford , Martinez , and Wilson shallow , or is this a park effect ? I thought Butler liked to play shallow .\",\n",

       " 'Is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly RBI \\' s ? This is the situation that brought the question up : The Red Sox were up in the bottom of the 9th by a score of 5 - 1 . The Mariners had the bases loaded with 1 out . The batter hits a fly to center , which the fielder catches . The runner at third tags and scores without a throw . Now , without a judgement call ( and I don \\' t think there is one ), this is an RBI for the batter . It seems to me that a better name for this would be \" defensive indifference \", since it doesn \\' t really matter whether the guy at third scores at that point . ( I know , I can think of several \" If the Mariners stole third and second , which opening the base would allow , and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and third , he wouldn \\' t have a play at home , third , or second for the out , and maybe he therefore can \\' t make the throw to first to get the last out , etc ... scenarios , too . But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when you \\' re down by 4 ? If the tying run is going to score , so is the guy on third .)

       " 'Here is a summary of Don Cherry \\' s coach \\' s corner from April 18 , 1993 . It took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal - Quebec series . Pre - game comments ----------------- Don \\' s pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies ... The goalie who gets back his all - star form ( Roy or Hextall ) can win the series for his team . Eposode Summary --------------- This episode took place rinkside . Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand . Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun . It featured a picture of Don , who just saw his shadow and proclaimed \" Will you look at dat , eh ? Means another 6 weeks of me . Beauty .\" Next , Don talked about the hot dog he was holding . According to him , the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL . From there , Don commented on the Quebec - Montreal game . The game had great flow , because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL . In contrast , the Calgary - LA game was terrible ... All stop - and - go , over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli . Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals . Next , Ron showed an old picture of Don , when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL . Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena ... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships . Finally , Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers . The rangers were a talented team who underachieved . Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith , who had several key injuries ( to Leetch and Patrick ) and goalies who went cold . Don had some criticism for the Rangers team ... The party \\' s over , Adolf ( Keenan ) is there . The Rangers organization will no longer be a \\' country club \\'.... \" NY should be achamed of themselves ... If they go in the tank with Adolf there , they \\' ll be hanging from the yardarm by their thumbs .\" Rating ------ Nothing too special in this episode .

       " 'There are many teams in the NHL who have taken a liking to Russian players . The \" whole Russian strategy \" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano , who was GM before Murray . What the previous GM also did was to trade away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams , most notably ( in my memory ) Murray Craven , who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here . Also , it \\' s not the volume of trades that will necessarily improve a team , but the quality of them . Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid , even if Federko used to be a great player at one time . Most of Murray \\' s trades have worked significantly to the Wings \\' advantage , with those that didn \\' t being soured mainly by injury to the players involved ( such as Troy Crowder , who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered ).

LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2 - 1 . LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards . The play went quickly with the refs running a no - holds - barred type of game . LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4 - 2 at the end of the second . Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game . Coach Walsh , of Maine , replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow , who won the game against Michigan . Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie . The third period , like the second , belonged to the team behind . Maine scored three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark . They were all scored by Jim Montgomery , the tournament MVP , and all assisted by Paul Kariya . The last minute of the game bears highlighting . The change to Snow also proved the difference in the end . With one minute to go and with the LSSU goalie pulled , Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by both . Snow won . It was a great way to end the game .

       " 'Disclaimer -- This is for fun . In my computerized baseball game , I keep track of a category called \" stolen hits \", defined as a play made that \" an average fielder would not make with average effort .\" Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols ( Thanks Sherri !), I \\' ve figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen . Hits Stolen have been redefined as \" Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made .\" OK , I realize that \\' s unfair . Kurt \\' s probably the victim of pitching staff , fluke shots , and a monster park factor . But let \\' s put it this way : If we replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt \\' s 57 . 6 % out making ability , how many extra hits would go by ? To try and correlate it to reality a little more , I \\' ve calculated Net Hits Stolen , based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make . By the same method I \\' ve calculated Net Double Plays , and Net Extra Bases ( doubles and triples let by ). Finally , I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution , or DCON :->. Basically , it represents the defensive contribution of a player . I add this number to OPS to get DOPS ( Defense + Onbase Plus Slug ), which should represent the player \\' s total contribution to the team . So don \\' t take it too seriously . The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article .

       " \"As the Sharks ' season came to a close tonight , I will start a series of posts , trying to revisit the players , the trades , the moves , etc ., that went through for the Sharks for the past season . If you are uninterested , since I will have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings , you can kill them . I will first try to evaluate how the players did . These ratings , of course , are subject to my own biases , but I hope that I can try to be as objective as possible . I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks and / or did not play for another NHL team this season . Thus , then , let ' s go to the goaltenders ... # 1 BRIAN HAYWARD Season : 11th Acquired : ' 91 - 92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : P ( D ) It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end , a career that featured sharing three Jennings Trophies ( with Patrick Roy , in ' 87 , ' 88 , and ' 89 ). It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade ( and skip the letter grading ), but he had simply been awful on ice this year , save for a bright spot or two , and even if he had been healthy , he would not be any more than the 3rd - string goalie . But Hayward was a classy individual , who also figured in on the Sharks ' first ever victory , the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames . As he retires , the fans will remember what a good guy he was . # 30 JEFF HACKETT Season : 3rd Acquired : ' 91 - 92 , from N . Y . Islanders in expansion draft Grade : C Hackett , after ( deservedly ) winning the team MVP honors last season , simply wasted the year . Other than a few good spots ( 57 saves against Los Angeles , almost - shutout against Tampa Bay , etc .), Hackett , finishing with 85 . 6 % save percentage and a 5 . 28 GAA , watched his status go from the team ' s # 1 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season . He was expected , early , to carry the team along ; instead , he apparently became frustrated , but the an early injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor , but upon return , he simply wasn ' t up to the task . He may not return next year . # 31 WADE FLAHERTY Season : 1st ( still eligible as rookie ) Acquired : ' 91 - 92 , signed as undrafted free agent Grade : I ( A -) It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone , thus the incomplete grade , but yet in the one start that he did get ( against the Calgary Flames ), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods . He started the season poorly in Kansas City , but finished strong , prompting the Blades ' owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP honors . The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the NHL ; last year , he was a capable backup for Arturs Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs , picking up all - star honors along with Irbe ; now it ' s time for him to show that he can share the job with Irbe next year , because with prospects Dan Ryder , Trevor Robins , and Scott Cashman coming along , if he doesn ' t make it next year , he may not ever . # 32 ARTURS IRBE Season : 1st Acquired : ' 91 - 92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : B + I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that he ' s a bona fide NHL goaltender , perhaps a bona fide # 1 goaltender . He has provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had , getting the team ' s first ever shut - out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26 . He has been fearless in and out of the net , aggressively playing the puck and making passes , reminding people of a young Ron Hextall ( except , of course , the goonism ). Yet he still needs to develop more consistency , which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him , but if the Sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season , Irbe ' s the key , as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts .\",\n",
       " 'NESN owns the rights to Bruin telecasts . I suspect that NESN was only going to sell one telecast to ESPN ( remember , ESPN only owns exclusive rights to the FINALS , not the entire playoffs ). Since ESPN bought the SCA contract , there are less wrangles to untie with showing the Devils and Penguins . I think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it . Plus they have no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule unless the NHL was willing to make a western club move up their game . I think the NHL got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for ABC . Same exact coverage as last week : Pit - NJ game 4 in the east , Chi - StL in the central , LA - Cgy in the mountains and west .',\n",

As to whether it does him any good to have Bonds behind him , the net . stat . mavens will probably tell you there ' s no reason that it should , but if he thinks it will , it might be a self - fulfilling prophecy . As to whether the Giants ' lineup is optimal : who knows ? Batting Bonds , the team ' s best hitter , fifth does seem to be odd , but the # 1 and # 2 hitters aren ' t exactly Messrs .

       " \"No . Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost , and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec won . Everybody said it would come down to goaltending , that goaltending was the key , etc etc . Well , the key doesn ' t quite fit if you ' re Montreal . The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call , but let ' s face it ; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow . Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow . He even saw the whole shot , dammit . Besides , Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT . Montreal played a solid game ( although they still don ' t know how to clear traffic in front of the net ; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more ). Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2 - goal lead with less than five , let alone two , minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads . But I don ' t think this was a team loss ( although Keane should have been able to clear the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal ). Roy is paid big money to play . He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic ' s shot . Demers should start Racicot in the next game . If not that , he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two .... and maybe this article , if possible . I didn ' t think the wrap - around was as bad as the second goal . I also didn ' t think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender ( can ' t remember who ) in the first place . But you are correct , it shouldn ' t have gone in regardless . Yep . Moog looked bad on Mogilny ' s goal with five seconds left in the second , IMO . How about Neely though ? Holy shit , what a player . Speaking of great players , man - oh - man can Quebec skate . I haven ' t seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time . Watching them break out of their zone , especially Sundin , is a treat to watch . They remind me of the Red Army . But I still hate the team . On the rest of the games : Didn ' t St . Louis ' winning goal come on a powerplay ? Penalties will cost Chicago dearly , especially against Detroit . Same goes for Calgary ; very , very undisciplined . When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to * avoid * fights , you know something ' s up . New Jersey was overmatched , Terreri ' s heroics notwithstanding . Mario is unbelievable , and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs . But I hate that team anyway .\",\n",

       " \"Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are finally moving in the right direction . They should finish over . 500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race in August . However , I would take back a few moves : 1 . The Jim Abbott Trade . I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person , but a great pitcher also . He could win the Cy Young this year , but he won ' t because the right side of the Yanks infield isn ' t good enough . So why was this not a good trade ? JT Snow . How many rookies have been able to step in and immediately have the impact that he has had so far on the Angels ? I know it ' s early , but if you ' ve seen this kid hit , field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be a tremendous player . The Yanks should have kept him . What about Mattingly , you ask ? Well - it ' s great that the Yanks have taken care of him and remained loyal , but he ' s 10 years older than Snow and just doesn ' t have the same bat speed as before his back injury . It ' s a shame , but as a Yankee fan who wants to see the * best * Yankee team , I ' d take Snow over Mattingly at first . The Yanks also gave up two promising propects with Snow for Abbott . Besides , with Domingo Jean , Brien taylor , Wickman , Militello , and Sterling Hitchcock , they are just loaded with propects . I know Abbotts only 26 , but this was too much to give up . I believe George forced this trade because he believes ( and he ' s right ) that Abbott will be a big hit in NY . However , I ' d like to see the Yankees build a baseball team , not an amusement show . 2 . Wade Boggs . I live in Boston and like Wade a lot . But , his career is winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop a long term solution ( i . e . Hensley Muelins , Russ Davis , Velarde ?). Besides , Wade just doesn ' t have any range . What a shame about Charlie Hayes , huh ? 3 . Spike Owen . See Wade Boggs . I ' d much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri or whoever . Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1 / 2 point . And these guys are on the down sides of their careers . 4 . Danny Tartabull . Yes - he ' s put up some tremendous numbers and it ' s nice to think about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year . But he never is . We should expect 120 games max out of him . Meanwhile , Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O ' Neil is playing left field ! I believe O ' Neil led NL outfielders in assists last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder . What I ' m basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right direction but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year . They should ( at the GM level ) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series . This means getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they will be ready in a year or two . I ' m afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner . Certainly , the Boggs deal was all George . It looks like George is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now . The veterans are always available and can be added at any time ( like Boston did this year ). Develop the young players first , then add the one or two veterans ( or in the Yankees case , just keep them ). Let ' s all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn ' t dismantle the terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee organization back into one of respect . I ' m really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today ( relief pitching for example ). George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away . Have patience George and we will all enjoy the future . Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it ' s baseball hell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time !\",\n",

The Orioles , Red Sox , and Yankees all disappeared . The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the expected pace . The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half . The Rangers predictably took a dive . That shouldn \\' t have surprised anybody . Meanwhile , as predicted , the Mariners dropped behind the Angels and Royals . They clearly didn \\' t deserve the 22 - 33 record in June . The White Sox and A \\' s upped their game a bit , while the Twins dropped off a little . But for the most part things were as expected .

She said that among other things , Berg was the principal spy for the OSS ( CIA ' s WWII precursor ) spying on Axis atomic programs , because of his physics background and language skills . She said that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland , and had instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb research ( he concluded they were two years behind , and didn ' t shoot him ). ( I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb program , but I don ' t know how reliable this is .) Unfortunately , NPR didn ' t mention any kind of a book she ' s writing -- I ' d certainly buy it . ( In case you ' re wondering about baseball relevance , Berg was a longtime MLB backup catcher . He was a member of an MLB All - Star team that toured Japan in 1934 , presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because he was one of the few Americans , much less MLB players , who spoke Japanese .

       " 'The FLYERS blew a 3 - 0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period , but Kevin Dineen \\' s 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win , 7 - 4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row . Alexander Mogilny led the comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd . Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots on goal to improve his own record to 20 - 17 - 6 as he was tested by Mogilny and LaFontaine all night . Roster move : Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey , Shawn Cronin was a healthy scratch . Lines : Eklund - Lindros - Recchi Beranek - Brind \\' Amour - Dineen Lomakin - Butsayev - Conroy Faust - Acton - Brown Galley - Bowen Yushkevich - Hawgood Carkner - McGill Tommy Soderstrom Game Summary : Say , if anybody from Buffalo is reading this , where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems ? We had to turn down the volume ! The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the first period . They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods . Maybe Tommy told them that he was getting bored back there ... Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it . After Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped , Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to Eric 1 / 2 way up on his left . Eric dropped it to Galley , and he sent it ahead to Recchi steaming out of the zone . Mark skated into the center circle , passed the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik , skated around him and in on Fuhr . Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick , Recchi drifted right , drifted back left , and slid the puck back to the right past Fuhr for a 1 - 0 FLYERS lead at 0 : 18 . It was so beautiful Eric and Garry should turn down their assists :-). The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that , but he was strong and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage . The game then became a defensive struggle for a while . The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10 : 26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into the boards in the FLYERS zone . LaFontaine got the only scoring chance , and not a terribly good one , as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play . Mogilny got a post after it was over . The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS . Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13 : 31 for taking down Mark Recchi to give the FLYERS a power play . The best penalty killing team in the league didn \\' t allow the FLYERS a shot on goal , although the FLYERS did create a good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot . Towards the end of the period the play started going end to end , but everybody kept missing the net . Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18 : 19 to give the Sabres another power play , but they couldn \\' t get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure , particularly when they iced the puck . Shots were 8 - 6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6 - 2 at one point . Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods . Jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs , but not discouraged . This was considered a rebuilding year after * The Trade * and he seemed very happy with the way the season went . When asked if he agonized over * The Trade * he said that it was Russ Farwell \\' s trade and not his , that it only was an issue for him and Ed Snider as far as the money . But yes , there was some agonizing , and they \\' d do it all over again . When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it \\' s Russ \\' call , and Russ will evaluate things at the end of the season . He feels that they \\' re 3 years away from a shot at the Cup . He expects to get into the playoffs next year , have a shot at a division title the following year , and a shot at the finals the year after that . This based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer . He \\' s very happy with the re - alignment ( he called it \" outstanding \"). Happy with the current expansion , feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of Europeans , but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable . Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics ( booo ) but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus . The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May took a tripping penalty at 0 : 51 of the second . The FLYERS had a little trouble getting started , but eventually did . Hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres blue line along the right boards . Eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle . He half fanned on it , and sent the puck trickling through the slot . Fuhr didn \\' t know where it was , though , and Hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2 : 15 . Then Mogilny on a breakaway . He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line and went in on Soderstrom . He went with the backhander , but Soderstrom was all over it . The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them . Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor , then according to Gary Dornhoefer took a dive to get the other ( there was no video ) at 4 : 22 . The Sabres coudln \\' t get started . Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the FLYERS zone , and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and headed the other way . It started out a 1 on 1 , but Brind \\' Amour hustled ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman . Dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3 - 0 FLYERS at 5 : 40 . That was all for Fuhr , John Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over . But the Sabres still had lots of power play time . Again they took some time to just get into the FLYERS zone , and when they finally did the FLYERS were all over them . Boos began to ring through the building . But they finally got through Soderstrom on an ugly goal . Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot . Hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it . Mistake # 1 , he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about A ) the rebound or B ) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net . Well , the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom , and mistake # 2 , Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie . He didn \\' t even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away . With the goal , at 7 : 48 , two streaks end for the FLYERS . 150 : 28 of shutout hockey , and 27 straight penalty kills . Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8 : 36 with a high sticking minor , I think it was Barnaby again . This time the Sabres were able to get set up quickly , but couldn \\' t get too much quality on goal . The Sabres continued to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended . Things evetually settled down , but then the other very bad penalty . McGill allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff . The gloves were dropped , and McGill started pounding the crap out of him . But during the fight , he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet , and that meant a match penalty . 2 for slashing , 5 fighting and 5 for the major , 7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14 : 15 , Barnaby only got 5 . The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while , but there was only so long they could do that . After a couple of good Sabre chances , Audette handed to Ledyard at the point , and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by Soderstrom . LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net , and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right . Soderstrom had moved over to play LaFontaine , and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men , Wood just slid it into the empty net at 17 : 34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3 - 2 . LaFontaine was actually trying to put it on net , but half fanned on it and got a break . The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone , but Hasek was strong . Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the neutral zone , and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS blue line . Another mini - breakaway for Mogilny , he elected to shoot from the left circle , and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 18 : 56 for his 75th of the season . Ironically , the youth hockey tip between the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off angles ... That was all in the 2nd , shots were 19 - 7 Sabres . Into the 3rd period , and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the FLYERS the lead back . A 2 on 1 , Acton with the puck , he dropped to Eklund in the slot , and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from . When he finally did shoot , he hit the far post . That was still during the carryover power play time . Than an incredible almost goal . Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood untouched into Soderstrom . Soderstrom goes down , Wood pokes the puck under Soderstrom , and a black object hits the back of the net . Red light comes on , horn sounds , crowd cheers . But up to the video replay booth , for some strange reason , and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing . Well , it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net , not the puck . Emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net ... Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2 : 35 . The FLYERS could not get anything going at all . They finally got set up 1 / 2 way through , but were kept on the perimeter . As time ran out , Beranek stripped the puck from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to Eklund at the top of the left circle . Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him . Dineen fumbled the pass , but twice directed it at Hasek , and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4 : 42 . 4 - 3 FLYERS . But the Sabres came right back . LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net . Erry started to skate out , but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net . Mogilny flew in , skated around , and stuffed it through Soderstrom \\' s 5 hole for his 76th at 5 : 24 to tie the game at 4 . Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5 : 55 . The FLYERS set up in the Sabres zone , and stayed there . Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in the middle . While Brind \\' Amour wrestled for the puck , Dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek \\' s glove side at 6 : 44 . Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8 : 19 . The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone . Brind \\' Amour and Ledyard went after it , and Rod got the puck . He backed away from the right boards , skated to the right faceoff dot , and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing through the slot all by himself . Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of Hasek for a 6 - 4 FLYERS lead at 8 : 39 . 3rd hat trick of the season for Dineen , 7th of his career , 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season . Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9 : 02 to kill the rest of the Sabres power play . Not much action on the 4 on 4 , and the Sabres got most of the chances on the FLYERS resulting power play . Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves . The Sabres weren \\' t able to pull Hasek as time was running out as the FLYERS wouldn \\' t allow any consistant possession for the Sabres . Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and Brind \\' Amour stripped it away from him . He pulled away and found Dineen on the other side of the left circle , and Dineen found Acton at the right of Hasek . He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders , and Acton chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19 : 48 on his 35th birthday . That was all the scoring , shots were 18 - 13 Buffalo , and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game . So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn \\' t been tested much in his last couple of starts . Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night ( unless he had a better night earlier in the season , but I don \\' t think so ). The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years , 30 goals for only 11 against with three shutouts . Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games with injury . 4 points out of 4th , clinched 5th place since the Rangers lose the tie breaker . A couple misc notes : Forget the Mike Keenan rumors , there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year . In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award , but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman . The Times of Trenton has reported that \" a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma \" has looked over Tommy Soderstrom \\' s medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future . Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year . His response was that he wants to come back , he feels he did a good job this year , but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if Farwell didn \\' t want him back .

The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds . There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better . Clayton ' s defense has been superb . McGee seems to like leading off this year . Manwaring is driving the ball . So on & so forth . I hope it continues ... I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real -- particularly the pitching .

My personal favorite move ( I ' m a goalie too ) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back of their skates when the ref isn ' t looking . Makes ' em go down like a ton of bricks , but doesn ' t cause injuries unless they don ' t know how to fall ( I ' m talking about hitting the blades here , not the foot ). It also makes the player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty . Unfortunately , it also leaves your blocker out of position for a short time ... I don ' t do this if a shot is likely on the short side . Hmm .... maybe I should mail Potvin this method ( in French and with helpful diagrams , of course ).

       " \"I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points . However , I think you approached this the wrong way . I believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does . I feel they were all much better players . I am not saying I fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more . IMHO Dave Kingman - definately not . They guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag . The rest of his career I do not think he was very feared by pitchers . I also do not think he did a lot for the game . I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I still would not back him for the Hall of Fame . Dave Winfield - I think so . He is feared by pitchers , he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are ( in my opinion - without stats ) better than Kingman ' s ( probably by quite a bit ). I also perceive him to be a leader , maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader . I think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society . Examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done ( I know some of this from when he was with the Yankees ). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I think it deserves some consideration . Lee Smith - Maybe , I would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of Kingman . Darrell Evans - No . Eddie Murray - Maybe , He has had a very good career , he is a leader ( although a silent one ), he is a good role model . Are the stats good enough ? I am not sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman ' s both the average as well as the power numbers ( but not as good as Winfield ' s ). Just think , Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years . Jeff Reardon - My guess is no , but it kind of depends on his numbers . Off the top of my head I would take Lee Smith first . Well , I strongly disagree here . Both of these guys deserve it for sure . I talked about leadership above , both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season . Robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers offensively . The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have shattered Aaron ' s home run mark by now . How many of those great plays saved games ? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game ? While I believe both of these guys have numbers , baseball is about more than numbers ( or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers ). Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame . As does George Brett who also belongs in this class of player . Steve Garvey - I am not sure , probably not but I guess I could see someone making a case for him . Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might bring up his name . Kirby Puckett - Probably . The only reason I do not say definately is he still has time left in his career . If he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately . Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt ? I think I heard something about him having some 53 records ( maybe they were not all good - I don ' t know I did not hear any of them just the number ). He has the numbers , he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model . I would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game ( probably not even top 20 ) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame because of his accomplishments ( no - hitters , strikeouts , respectable numbers - even with some weaker teams ) you can go on and on . I really hope he gets ALL the possible votes . So in summing up I have 3 groups , those that belong , those that probably do but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don ' t belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go . Yes - Winfield , Yount , Brett ( not in your mail ), O . Smith , Puckett and Ryan Maybe - Murray and L . Smith No - Reardon , Garvey , Morris , Evans and definately Kingman As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions .\",\n",

He was even offered the many concessions he rudely demanded , such as guaranteed season ticket sales , cheap rent at the other two arenas in town , etc . Oh well , I guess the bottom line is $$$. Green wanted immediate huge returns in Dallas , and wasn ' t willing to wait another year or so in MN . Dallas gave Green a pretty stellar deal to play there ( although I feel Minnesota ' s was quite reasonable ), and he also has some cronies down there as well . All this means , is that Minnesota is without an NHL team for a year or two . Too bad for the NHL .\",\n",

       " '4 / 23 / 93 BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN , LEAD SERIES 3 - 0 ----------------------------------------------------- It was a great atmosphere last night at the St . Louis Arena as Joseph and the Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game . People were cheering the Blues long before face - off time , and they kept going for the entire game . My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning hours with some of the players . Here \\' s a game summary from the St . Louis Post - Disptach . Enjoy ... By Dave Luecking Of The Post - Dispatch Staff : At 10 : 24 p . m . Friday night , The Arena crowd of 17 , 965 paid homage to Blues goalie Curtis Joseph . The fans began bowing , their arms extended , taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read `` Only God Saves More Than Joseph .\" It was a fitting tribute to Joseph , who has brought the Blues to the verge of a surprising sweep . Joseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday , blanking the Blackhawks 3 - 0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3 - 0 lead in the best - of - seven series . The Blackhawks haven \\' t scored against Joseph since the 8 : 51 mark of the second period of Game 1 . Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds , a Blues record . Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146 : 28 , set in the first round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers , one of only two series the Blues have sweeped in their history . The Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4 , a nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday . The Blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history , both in 1969 , when they swept Philadelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals . The shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to make 47 saves . This time , the Blues held the shots down to 34 , and the Blackhawks couldn \\' t touch Joseph . Well , they touched Joseph , numerous times , shoving him and pushing him at every opportunity to try to get him off his game . But Joseph and the Blues were unfazed , dishing out their own punishment along the way . The Blues \\' grinders -- Bob Bassen , Rich Sutter , Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry -- wore down the Blackhawks , taking the visitors from Chicago off their game . The grinders set the stage for the glamour boys , the gifted playmakers and scorers , who made the most of their opportunities . Craig Janney , Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored , getting one goal in each period . Hull assisted on Janney \\' s first - period power play goal after two unwise Chicago penalties . Checker Miller set up Hull \\' s goal in the second period , and rookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson , who scored at 16 : 44 of the final period . Blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling `` Sweep . Sweep . Sweep .\" They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour `` Bell - Four . Bell - Four .\" They also chanted `` Na , na - na - na , hey - hey good bye .\" Such talk is a tad premature . There \\' s still one game left , but the Blues are on a roll . They have the Blackhawks on their heels . The Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play . Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment , and Brendan Shanahan dumped Steve Smith at center ice . Chicago tried to retaliate , but Troy Murray \\' s decision to run into Joseph backfired . Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty . The Blues didn \\' t get a shot on goal on the power play , and they survived a scare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to Steve Larmer . Joseph stopped Larmer \\' s shot and everything else Chicago threw at him in the first period . The \\' Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low , where Joseph \\' s butterfly style is deadly . Rookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two shots on goal , as many as Miller . The Blues \\' penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour . Marouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up . He caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican \\' s third penalty . He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14 : 58 , and gave the Blues a two - man advantage 1 : 07 later when Christian Ruuttu slashed Shanahan . The Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play , and Hull got it where he likes it -- in the high slot . Hull \\' s shot hit Belfour \\' s right shoulder , and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line . Belfour dived back to cover , but the puck squirted loose to Janney , who poked it into the net at 16 : 53 for his first goal of the playoffs . The Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended , and the Blackhawks lost their composure . Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds remaining in the period , and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by shooting the puck into the Blues \\' bench . Chris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice , and Marouelli slapped him with a 10 - minute misconduct . Chicago survived the Blues \\' power play , but the loss of Chelios hurt . He didn \\' t return until the midway point of the period , and within three minutes of his return , Hull had increased the Blues \\' lead to 2 - 0 , deflecting in Miller \\' s crisp pass . Try as they might , the Blackhawks couldn \\' t get to Joseph , who stopped everything they could throw at him . He stopped 12 shots in the second period and 13 more in the third . Chicago also hit the goalpost twice . Emerson \\' s goal put the game away . He went hard to the net and redirected Felsner \\' s pass .',\n",

Next , Roger Hansson - behind the goal - sent the puck back to the blue line where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn \\' t see the puck since there was traffic in front , 4 - 3 . Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \" the Shadow \" Nilsson . Stefan and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone , Patrik passed the puck back to Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake , 5 - 3 . Then , Keijo Sailynoja show started . He reduce and equalized the lead in only 21 seconds ! First he scored the 5 - 4 goal , and after that he came in alone with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot . Sailynoja made a nice penalty shot , showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot . The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6 - 5 goal late in the game on a nice power play combination . Renberg waited in the slot , showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side , Ahlund passed the puck and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer \\' s goal \\' s far side . But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the game \\' s final goal to make it 6 - 6 . Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow angle that - maybe - Aslin should have saved . All in all , a decent game where the defense wasn \\' t the best . Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period to try no combinations . Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team . Larsson - Nilsson - Juhlin best line overall again , it seems to be a working WC line . Stillman good on defense . Some players aren \\' t good enough for the WC though . Hakan Ahlund ( faell ner hjaelmen och jobba !), Roger Hansson , Challe Berglund , Kenny Jonsson will likely have to leave for NHL pros . Two - goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the Finnish team . Markus Ketterer didn \\' t have a very good game , we \\' ve seen him a lot better , so Lindfors is probably Finland \\' s starting goalie in the WC . I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team .

       " 'Let \\' s be careful here . If players \\' performance was completely random in ( Clutch - No Clutch ), then you would still expect some players to be good in the clutch every year and some to be not - so - good every year . With two years worth of data , you \\' d have 1 / 4 of the players good each year , 1 / 4 bad each year , and 1 / 2 would have one good and one bad year . We have 96 players for 5 years (\\' 84 -\\' 88 ). Just flipping a coin , you \\' d expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year . This is what we actually get -- No . of good years 0 1 2 3 4 5 Clutch performers 4 10 37 24 18 3 Coin flip ( random ) 3 15 30 30 15 3 Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process leading to deviations from non - clutch performance was completely random . If there was anything to clutch hitting ( at least in this definition ) that had any predictive capability , you expect to see the number of players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping a coin . Further , if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above or below average in clutch situations ( say , 1 standard deviation from the mean ) more than one year , the random explanation still looks good . In the four years (\\' 84 -\\' 87 ) that I looked at the data from Elias , there were 79 ( 29 ) players with a minimum of 25 ( 50 ) at bats in clutch situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years . Of those 79 ( 29 ) players , 38 ( 14 ) of them changed sign between the two years . In other words , they were great clutch hitters one year and really horrible the other year . If it was just a random process , you \\' d expect those numbers to be 39 . 5 ( 14 . 5 ). Everything that \\' s been measured about clutch hitting over a period of years that could be used to predict any ability with any proposed definition has looked like a random process ( with the caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage that could be dragged out of the data -- e . g ., John Lowenstein probably never had a \" clutch \" AB against a left - handed pitcher , but he might well have had some in blowouts , so that there would be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his platoon advantage ). This is not a subject that has been glanced at casually . A lot of people have put a lot of effort into studying it and every one of them , with the exception of the Elias study , has been unable to find anything that would allow you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better than flipping a coin . ( Self - serving plug follows : some of the flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth - coming SABR book , _The Perfect Game_ , by Taylor Publishing .

While there are some that play in the AHL , or the IHL where that ' s an NHL team ' s primary farm club , you don ' t hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL , the ECHL , or on the secondary farm teams in the IHL . ( ie . the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton , but I don ' t believe there are any Europeans in Ft . Wayne .)) So with all those teams , there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America . I ' m in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world . I ' ve grown up with Europeans playing on ' my ' team , and some of those players were the among the best in the world . From Hedberg , Nilsson , and Sjoberg , to Sel { nne , Zhamnov , and Olausson , and all those in between and to come , I wouldn ' t have it any other way .\",\n",

       " \"I ' ve never seen a game where one player has committed 5 penalties . Something like this would require more attention by the referee . But you ' re creating a scoring opportunity where there might not have been one before . I can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls , but it ' s obviously easier to score in basketball , there are more opportunities . If a basketball team scores 100 points , that ' s at least fifty chances made . The average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game ( and this is a total guess ) is probably around 40 , and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe 5 of them . You have some good ideas concerning the other penalties , but I think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with . Also , later in the post , you talked about how boring the NBA game you attended was , that play was stopped too often .

       " \"For your information , Lankford is injured ( I think it is his shoulder or rib cage ), so he could not use him as a pinch hitter . I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards . He does not have too much offensive capabilities , but he is an awesome defensively . Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense ?:) I forgot who St . Louis gave up for him , but it was not too much . As far as Gilkey is concerned , he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan , who beat him out . I expect to see a Gilkey / Jordan platoon in LF . I agree with you on this one . As soon as Larkin threw that ball , I knew that Lankford was a dead bird . But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make a perfect throw ? I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball . Don ' t forget the overachieving Cards of ' 91 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place ( although they were oveshadowed by the Braves / Twins last to first climb ). He won a division title , and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the Braves ( why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I will never understand ). With Torre at the controls , the Cardinals are heading in the right direction . One more thing , one game does not make a season . Yes , they lost to the Reds , but with the second best pitching staff in the National League ( first in the East ), and a pretty good offense , the Redbirds will win a lot more than they lose . Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way .

The Mets ( HOW ABOUT DOC ' S PERFORMANCE TODAY ?!!!!!) have reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder , and changed the Mets insgnia on the front of the jersey . To my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962 , and it reminds me a little of the Dodger logo . Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform , or at least uniforms that look more traditional . ( Phillies , Reds , Expos , White Sox , Padres , etc .) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray . The trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years , as opposed to the cookie - cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties .

       " 'By Dave Luecking Of The Post - Dispatch Staff At 9 : 11 Thursday night , the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer . Their cheer quickly turned into a roar , and finally , the sellout crowd of 17 , 816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff - bound Blues . The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5 , Stars 3 . With the North Stars \\' loss , the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division . Good thing , because the Blues quit playing . They held a 5 - 1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit - Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period . They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6 - 5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer . Tampa \\' s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers , but officiating supervisor John D \\' Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired . `` I \\' m glad I didn \\' t see it go in at the end ,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said . If the goal had counted , he \\' d have been more upset than he was by the Blues \\' disappearance in the final 24 minutes . Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry \\' s anger . `` It wasn \\' t pretty at the end ,\" he said . `` We played 36 , 37 great minutes , as good as we played all year . It slipped away at the end . It shouldn \\' t have , but it did .\" Still , the Blues won , prompting another ovation from the crowd at game \\' s end . Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season , the Blues still made the playoffs . They \\' ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best - of - seven Norris Division semifinal , beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium . The Blues finished the regular - season with a record of 37 - 36 - 11 for 85 points , their fourth consecutive plus -. 500 season . Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place , with a record of 36 - 38 - 10 for 82 points . Tampa Bay , which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2 - 2 at Tampa , ended its first season with a record of 23 - 54 - 7 for 53 points . The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room . Instead , the mood was one of relief and some disappointment . `` It \\' s a shame we let down ,\" said Kevin Miller , one of three Blues to score two goals . Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others . `` There was no need for a letdown . If we \\' d have kept working , it would have ended 6 - 2 and everyone would be happy .\" Instead , a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs . `` We won , and that \\' s all that matters ,\" said Brett Hull , scoreless and minus - 3 for the night . `` Once we got up 4 - 0 , it was really tough to play .\" Some players didn \\' t have a problem . `` Just because the score was announced , our line didn \\' t quit ,\" said Rich Sutter , who played with Bassen and Miller . `` We still had a game to play . You can \\' t allow five goals like we did , that \\' s not right . `` It was disappointing to see what was going on .\" Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues \\' effort . Somehow , he missed the announcement of Minnesota \\' s loss . `` I didn \\' t know it was final ,\" he said . `` I was kind of looking around on the bench . I didn \\' t realize it was a final for some reason . We \\' re in the playoffs , and that \\' s great , but it \\' s a little disappointing to play like we did at the end .\" The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota - Detroit score off of the board . The score showed 0 - 0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4 - 2 in the third period . The Blues already led 4 - 0 at the time . `` I told them I didn \\' t want to see the score , I didn \\' t want to know the score ,\" Berry said . `` I felt we had to win the game , and that \\' s the approach we took .\" If Minnesota took a lead , Berry feared , the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues . If Detroit led , he worried , the Blues might quit . Until the announcement , the Blues played splendidly . Shanahan got the crowd going at 10 : 44 of the first period , scoring his 50th of the season . Then , Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period . With the teams playing four on four , Miller broke in on left wing , deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21 . 6 seconds remaining in the period . Then , just 10 . 5 seconds later , Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone . Bassen made it 4 - 0 just 14 seconds into the second period , scoring on the rebound of Bret Hedican \\' s shot . The goal gave him his first two - goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend . Last year , Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill , who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb . 23 . `` I was thinking of my buddy Oliver ,\" Bassen said . `` He \\' s in heaven now , and I know he was watching . I know he \\' s happy .\" Miller increased the Blues lead to 5 - 0 on a break - away goal set up by Zombo at 11 : 09 . Then , Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph \\' s shutout just 18 seconds later , making it 5 - 1 . Less than a minute after the North Stars \\' final was announced , Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5 - 2 . But Shanahan scored his 51st , converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21 . 3 seconds remaining in the second period . Then , it was all Lightning . Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period , prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph . Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1 : 21 midway through the third period . The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan \\' s second goal stand up as the winner . `` We were in there ,\" Shanahan said . `` The game was over . We were in .\"',\n",

       " \"- - I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton . - Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference - next week . While the exact details are not known , it is believed - to concern the Oiler ' s future . - - Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement - with Copps Collesium in Hamilton . During the press conference , - Pocklington may announce the deal . It is quite possible that - the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to - renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium . - - Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $ 65 million earlier , - but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington . - - As for me , my opinion is divided ... Edmonton has been fairly - supportive of the Oilers . Even though they ' re a small market - team , they had many sellouts in the 80s . Even with the problems - that the team had this year , they still brought in more fans - than many teams in larger cities did . On the other hand , if - the team does move , there is no place more deserving than - Hamilton . Of course , how would that affect the grand - realignment scheme of Bettman ? - Following up on this , the provincial government has been asked by the Opposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton . The government said that Pock is going nowhere ! Why don ' t I believe the government ? Wasn ' t it Pocklington who wanted to be Tory leader 9 years ago ?\",\n",

Symthe Division playoff hockey this was . Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face - off . The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out - standing team defense . It took the Flames 9 : 45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal . The Kings , ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing , shut down the Flames . The Flames went 0 - 8 on the power play and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities . The Kings had their problems on the power play , yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries . The Kings forwards back - checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line , allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the Flames . Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex - pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday . Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg .

Interviewed on the radio this morning , he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday . 1st period : 1 - 0 . The Kings got things started right off the opening face - off . Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor . He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net . The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom . He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up . Gretzky set up in \\' his office \\', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in . Sydor , who got the puck between the face - off dot and the hash mark , shot off the pass , beating Vernon low and between the legs . Millen and Fleury went off at 4 : 57 .

With 6 seconds left in the 5on4 , Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game . 1 - 1 . Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play . Kurri , with the puck in the neutral zone , tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line . Suter skated down the near wing and into the Kings zone . He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri . As he cut thorugh the crease , he got Hrudey to go with him and he put the puck behind Hrudey , on his stick side for a short hander . 2 - 1 . The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play . Shuchuk , in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net . Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot where 2 Kings ( Shuchuk and Granato ) were being checked by 3 Flames . Carson came from the far corner , picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease . 3 - 1 . The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later . Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line . Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy . Huddy shot off the pass , from the near face - off dot , beating a diving Vernon on the glove side . 4 - 1 . 2 : 59 later , the Kings had a 3 goal lead . McSorley took a shot form the near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards . Marty got his own rebound , skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon . Skrudland went off at 10 : 53 but the Kings could not convert . Sydor went off at 12 : 35 and Watters went off at 14 : 40 , giving the Flames a 5 second 5 - 3 but they failed to convert . McSorley went off at 17 : 19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking at 17 : 31 . Sandstrom went off at 18 : 03 to close out the period . The Kings hit 3 goal post in the period . 3rd period : The Kings used the phrase \" Initiate , not retaliate \" and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game . 5 - 1 . The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1 : 06 mark . The Kings shot the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone . Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it . Donnelly , who was behind him , wacked at the puck , sending it into the low slot . As Vernon slid back in to the crease , Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon . Sydor went off at 1 : 24 ; Nieuwendyk went off at 3 : 22 as the teams skated 4 on 4 . 5 - 2 . Otto , skating down the far side , stepped around McSorley , cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot . Dahlquist cut through the top of the crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey . Carson and Rychel came in on a 2 - 1 . When Carson passed across to Rychel , Fleury tripped Rychel with no call . The puck got shoveled into the far corner where Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards , drawing a 5 - minute major and a game misconduct at the 6 : 08 mark . Unfortunately , the Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato ( at 6 : 44 ) and Watters ( at 8 : 19 ) took penalties . 5 - 3 . The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8 : 47 mark . MacInnis , at the near point , passed to Yawney at the far point . He took a few strides towards the net , wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey . The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost . Timeout - LA . 6 - 3 . MacInnis took a penalty at 9 : 56 and the Kings converted on the power play to seal the victory . Sandstrom , skating down the far wing in the Flames zone cut towards the back of the net . Just as he crossed the goal line , he passed the puck into the low slot , on the far side , to Carson who shot off the pass , beating Vernon on the ice , stick side . At the 16 : 17 mark , Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he went after Shuchuk . Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing , a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct , and he took the Flames right out of the game . On the plus side : The Kings , for the most part , played very disciplined hockey as they let Calgary retaliate . The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing . On the minus side : The Kings lost almost every face - off . This must improve or the Flames will surely get that power play back on track . Notes : ------ The Kings recalled Guy Leveque , Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix . Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point . The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against , giving the opposing team an average of 34 . 4 shots per game . Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3 - 9 - 1 record in afternoon games . The Flames entered the game with a 34 % success rate on the power play over their last 9 games . The teams were 3 - 3 - 1 against each other in the regular season .

He noted that the offices for the league are in Spring . and many ex - Indians are working for the AHL . Furthermore , he also informed me that back a few years ago in the Cup finals between Roch and Spring , that the Amerks charged favoritism by the office and that : \"... there were little questionable things liket he AHL president and staff attending all games with the Springfield brass , including sitting in their box for the game in Springfield and , according to the Rochester media , openly cheering for Springfield .\" Certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this is true .

That \\' s an entirely different purpose than sending the letter to Bettman . Unfortunately ... The \" largest computer networks in the world \" phrase is a definition of the Internet , not a group as a whole that she claims to represent .

Now I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them . 65 people may be up there , thereby validating definition 2 . I would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large , which would give it a large scope . Why would he be impressed with this unless it were \" large \"?

The A ' s brain trust came to believe that his back problems were exacerbated , if not caused , by having a wide open stance , closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque ( that ' s a paraphrase of what I remember ). In any event , Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance , and the A ' s began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power .

       " \"After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that Milwaukee should have an NHL team , I thought I ' d pass along a story I heard recently . This is second hand , so I don ' t know how true it is , but I have no reason to doubt it either . Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge hockey team . The owner of the Admirals ( sorry , I can ' t remember his name ) either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the Bradley Center . Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise , but turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $ 50 million was too high . Like I said , I don ' t know whether this story is true or just a rumor , but if it ' s true , don ' t look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon . The Admirals aren ' t going to be forced out of the building and you won ' t see an NHL club and a minor league club in the same building , especially since the NBA ' s Milwaukee Bucks play there as well .\",\n",

I ' m wondering if this is a recent change in stance for him ? Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter . He could always be fooled by a curve ball low and away . If this is indeed a new stance for him , maybe he is not being fooled as easily ? As for his patience , Dennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff . If he was grooving pitches to Andres , you can hardly fault him for drilling them ( which he did !). Does Andres generally start hot or cold ?

Someone posted the playoff point total and he ' s in something like fifth or sixth place .... plus , he walked away with the Molson cup ( given for accumulating points from the three star selection ) during the regular season . 2 .

I do have to agree that the officiating last night was pro - Leaf in general ( except for whoever missed that slash on Gilmour ' s hand ). 3 .

       " 'Well , it looks like , just as Doug trumped Tim , beating him to the net with his defensive analyses , so Tim has gotten in ahead of me . The way I was doing it was a little different . Being me , of course , I used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth , and I calculated both rate of performance ( fielding equivalent average ) and total performance ( fielding equivalent runs ). But I compared , not to the average player , but the replacement player , and here \\' s why : because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system . In the AL of 1992 , the average SS is 32 . 9 runs above replacement ( RAR ); cf , 31 . 6 ; 2B , 28 . 8 ; 3B , 26 . 3 ; LF , 26 . 0 ; RF , 24 . 6 ; 1B , 16 . 9 . We may quibble with the exact numbers , but the order looks substantially right . In the equivalent average , I have always set league average to . 235 . I had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of . 180 ; the name of that replacement level hitter , often as not , is \" Billy Ripken \". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the same distance from . 235 as . 180 , but in the opposite direction as I have set it up ; that makes for an eqa of . 280 . ( Yes , I can add . Runs are proportional to eqa squared ; the difference between 180 squared and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared , and I rounded off for simplicity ). An all - replacement fielding team would have : Randy Milligan at first (. 282 ), Willie Randolph (. 269 ) at second , Leo Gomez (. 279 ) at third , Walt Weiss (. 269 ) at short , Kevin Bass (. 271 ) in left , HoJo (. 257 ) in center , and Eric Anthony (. 277 ) in right . Ugh . So , the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and fielding RAR . I can rate them by total RAR , or RAR per some number of batting outs , like 400 . An average player has a total RAR of about 55 , 30 batting , 25 fielding . Total RAR ( bat / field ) 1 . Bonds 152 ( 124 / 28 ) Ventura 124 ( 66 / 58 ) 2 .

       " ': That \\' s not inner calm . It \\' s boredom , and it \\' s being spoiled . The Arena \\' s : been as quiet as a church on many nights this year ; too many of us just : take winning for granted . It \\' s been seemingly forever since the team : lost , and we \\' ve forgotten what it \\' s like to feel real excitement and : surprise at victory . At least last night there was some excitement . The Pens didn \\' t have it wrapped up before the game was half over like the previous two games . I \\' m not sure if NJ just rose up and played better or if the Penguins just started to play down somewhat . Probably it was somewhere in between . New Jersey seemed much more aggressive last night in the Pens end . They did much more swarming around , which at least kept an element of suspense in the game . No question that Billington helped make it more interesting also . Claude Lemieux didn \\' t help the cause any though , with his ejection early in the game . So , who \\' s going to start in the Devils goal for the \" final \" game Sunday ? ;-) Sorry . I couldn \\' t help myself .',\n",

However , I am completely and profoundly ignorant when it comes to hockey equipment . I ' ve checked out local stores and looked at catalogs , but I was hoping to solicit opinions / suggestions before actually plunking down any money . Having played football in high school and college I at least have that equipment as a basis for comparison .

       " 'Having run completely out of time , I \\' ve got to get my prophesies and predictions for the A . L . out . Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year \\' s prediction contest . AL East -- 1993 1 . Baltimore Orioles Why the Orioles ? Well , I pondered long and hard , and it all came down to this : -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction . -- Can \\' t bring myself to pick the Yankees -- Milwaukee was a fluke -- Indians aren \\' t ready to contend -- Red Sox were bad last year , and didn \\' t get any better -- Detroit \\' s pitching will be the new definition of \" replacement level \" \" But you don \\' t really think the Orioles will win , do you .\" No . As a matter of fact , I can \\' t see any team in the American League winning either division on paper ( with the possible exception of the Yankees , who I hate ). But some - body has to win , so I pick the Orioles . \" You don \\' t really think that Brady Anderson is going to repeat , do you ?\" No . I \\' m basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis . \" Glenn Davis ? That \\' s insane \". Yes . So , without further ado : STRONG POINTS : Hoiles , Ripken some years , Olson , getting rid of Billy Ripken . WEAK POINTS : Segui may start . Valenzuela ( the original 30 - something ) may be the fifth starter . Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup . ( Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize the effect of a slumping Ripken ? If you can \\' t move Ripken out of the # 3 spot , why not move the rest of the line up ?) WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year . WOULD BE A BAD SIGN : In a tight pennant race , team trades for Pecota . ObPrediction : \" The Streak \" continues . Harold Reynolds leads the team in caught stealing . 2 . New York Yankees . STRONG POINTS : Abbot , Key , Perez . Could have best pitching in American League . Boggs should improve on Hayes . WEAK POINTS : Mattingly still considered best hitter . The Steinbrenner factor . ( The Yankees lost to the Mets . Can wholesale changes be far behind ?) Never count on rookie pitchers ( i . e . Wickman & Millitello ) to win a division . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Boggs hits over . 300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN : Howe gets arrested again . ObPrediction : Mattingly won \\' t top a 700 OPS . 3 . Toronto Blue Jays STRONG POINTS : Management willing to make big deals . Management has eerie power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects . Olerud . Guzman . Alomar . WEAK POINTS : The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick . Losing Stewart may hurt rotation ( that \\' s * really * a bad sign ). No one in the outfield can get on base . Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN : Club makes no major deals in August . ObPrediction : Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year . And have a losing record . 4 . Milwaukee Brewers STRONG POINTS : Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year . WEAK POINTS : Molitor gone . Surhoff at third ? Why ? Eldred can \\' t keep it up . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Listach and Eldred play like last year . WOULD BE BAD SIGN : Bones plays like last year . ObPrediction : Surhoff won \\' t finish the year at third . 5 . Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS : Baerga , Belle , Nagy WEAK POINTS : Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts . Starts Felix Fermin . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Bielecki \\' s ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts . WOULD BE A BAD SIGN : Ted Power -- bullpen ace . ObPrediction : Alomar will be back on the DL by the all - star break . 6 . Boston Red Sox STRONG POINTS : Clemens , Viola , Clemens , Detroit , Clemens WEAK POINTS : Most incompetent GM in baseball . Key free agent signing -- Andre Dawson . Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Rainouts in between Clemens starts . WOULD BE A BAD SIGN : Clemens on the DL ObPrediction : Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon . Interpret that how you will :-> 7 . Detroit Tigers STRONG POINTS : Tettleton , Phillips , Whitaker WEAK POINTS : If Fielder keeps declining , he \\' ll be a shortstop this year . Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better . This year could be * very * ugly . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP .

       " \"I ' ve been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the A ' s conditioning guru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help his back . Although I don ' t for one second believe Jose used steroids , his back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame ( see Jeff Bregel ex 49er as a textbook example ), and IMHO Jose is too big for his frame . I can ' t imagine how to estimate bat speed , but its pretty obvious that Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit , likely due to his back . I don ' t know , he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the A ' s , and had no problems with it then . It might be that pre - back problems , he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused , but now he ' s lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him . The old saying if you ' re hot its a trigger mechanism , if you ' re cold , its a hitch . The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he ' s comfortable with for more than a few months . He changes his stance so much , he loses track of where the strike zone is . In Wednesday ' s night game , he was clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me . I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he ' s changed his stance so much . I ' m also a bit concerned that because he ' s got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns , he ' ll become competitive , swing even harder and screw himself up even worse .

       " 'Wow , this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team , Boston . Which Sweeney you ask ... well , of course Bob Sweeney , the one that Boston let Buffalo get a hold of ( they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing ). Game winner in OT in game 1 , and another BIG goal ( seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why Grant has 5 rings !!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd . Yes , Neely countered a minute later , but hadn \\' t this course of Buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities , I think Boston would have notched their first win of the series . Well , the Sabres haven \\' t made it to the end of this series yet , but I certainly feel they \\' ve got Boston right were they want them ... actually , they \\' ve got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt that would come about . One more astronomical game by Fuhr , a few more heroics by the rest of the team ( this is a team sport afterall ) and I think Borque , Neely , Jouneau ( sp ?), and Company are gonna be swinging a new stick ( Weather is perfect for golf season ) real soon . I \\' m not gonna waiger anything on this , because I \\' ve seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey . Talking about golf ... was that a hockey swing , golf swing or baseball swing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev deflected in for the BIG ONE ? The whole OT ( all 1 minute of it !) was a tesiment to Buffalo \\' s ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end ( something they weren \\' t necessarily in the regular season ). The Sabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in the opening seconds . I don \\' t normally like penalties being called in such ultra - critical points , but this was BLATENT . Finally , the Sabres won a faceoff ( they weren \\' t that hot in this dept the rest of the game ) when LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times .

       " 'I don \\' t buy this at all . Roy was the reason the game was tied ... and that would * not * have been the case had Dionne kept his cool . Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... Both Dionne \\' s and Bellows \\' shots were misplayed by Hextall , but just because his gaffes were early in the game , no one seems to care . Roy stood on his head for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from end - to - end . Kamensky \\' s mini - break after the tying goal and the first shot by Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy . Roy outplayed Hextall for most of the game , but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero because Roy \\' s team didn \\' t make full use of their opportunities . Hextall , on the other hand , had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very well , but the Haller shot off the post in OT , the rebound bouncing over Bellows \\' stick , the Brunet breakaway , the 3 chances for LeClair ... all those opportunities were * not * finished off by Montreal , and it cost them . Hextall wasn \\' t particularly brilliant on those plays ... Sure , no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal . The timing stank , but against an explosive team like Quebec , they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary . I disagree . Roy played well because he wasn \\' t screened the whole night . The defense , for the 1st time this season , played remarkably , keeping Sakic , Nolan , and Sundin out of the slot most of the night . This most certainly was a team loss ... Leclair missed his opportunities , as did Bellows and Brunet . Dionne took a bad penalty . Damphousse and Lebeau were * silent *. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night . Roy gave up the bad goal . Roy , by no means , can be singled out for this loss . And Hextall didn \\' t on Dionne \\' s goal ? Please . Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5 , when you consider the defense , or lack of one , that played in front of him for most of the season . The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs . They are no better than uninformed fans . Why should they read the papers ? They played 58 minutes of \" Burnsian \" hockey to shut down Quebec . All they need tonight , and for the rest of the series is the extra 2 . Red Light to face Quebec ... rubbish . That \\' s a guaranteed way to end the series 4 - 0 . Who would be taught a lesson by this ? The fans , the media , and Racicot , perhaps . Certainly not the rest of the team . If you mean the goal should never have gone in , because there should never have been an OT , then I agree . But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Young . Roy had both the near and far posts covered , but Young flipped the puck up under Roy \\' s arm as he wrapped - around the net ... not a bad goal at all .',\n",
       " \"< In response to a debate about who has has a better season - Jagr of Francis > I think Jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time - stats don ' t exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better +/-. +/- is a useful statistic . If a player is on the ice when his team scores a lot of goals and only allows a few goals , he must be doing something right . It is especially useful to compare between teammates - as they play for the same team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally good players . It can be adjusted - with varying degrees of success to compare between players on different teams . I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics - but how useful are the ones that you suggest ?? Total ice time would be very useful - it is a missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before . Somehow measuring the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless . It would be a better stat for evaluating coaching - ie are the players given quality ice time actually their talented ones ? A very good player could be given low amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who doesn ' t recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that thinks he is an effective player . This stat would be much more flawed than +/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent . +/- is a useful stat . It is quite useful in evaluating player talent . You are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed is a very positive thing - and should be evaluated as such .\",\n",

       " \"I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues . The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis , as they had little talent on their roster for some time . Steve Avery , for example , was rushed to the majors , and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign . His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5 + ERA during his rookie year . Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound . Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors ( out of Arizona State directly ) had good numbers immediately . I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith , Craig McMurty , and Derek Lilliquist . The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed . Lilliquist and Smith struggled , but it didn ' t hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped . I seem to recall CM pitching well initially , though I don ' t have stats handy .\",\n",
       " \"Minor point : Shea Stadium was designed as a multi - purpose stadium but not with the Jets in mind as the tennant . The New York Football Giants had moved to Yankee Stadium ( from the Polo Grounds ) in 1958 and was having problem with stadium management ( the City did not own Yankee Stadium until 1972 ). The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea . When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the new AFL franchise , the New York Titans , approached the City about using the new stadium . The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium ( where the Cosmos played soccer in the 70s ). Because Shea Stadium was tied into the World ' s Fair anyway , the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the World ' s Fair ( like they were doing with the Mets ). So the deal was worked out . I ' m under the impression that when Murph says it , he means it ! As a regular goer to Shea , it is not a bad place since they ' ve cleaned and renovated the place .

The \" Patient / Power \" guys ? Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and Rickey Henderson has \" a strike zone the size of Hitler \\' s heart \" so they get their walks based on the small zone . Look at the other 5 guys : Thomas , Bonds , McGwire , Ruth and Williams . Wow ! A lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them . The pitchers would do better ( in my opinion ) by just coming after them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch , but pitchers would rather nibble , go 2 - 0 or 3 - 1 and then get hurt .',\n",

       " \"I think that NHLPA ' 93 is the best video game available now . of course many things could be done better , but i really appreciate that the names of players are the real ones , no matter if it lacks some logos ... I am still playing it since November leading different teams to the finals and making scorers from the same team compete for the top scoring : Yesterday I won the title using Toronto against Hartford ( 4 games to two ), I played the playoffs in a 7 games fashion ( 5 minutes for each period ) and the best scorer and shooter was Gilmour ( 116 shots if I remember well ) -- _____________________________________________________ Iskander AYARI\",\n",

The Habs dominated the game from the 5 : 00 mark of the first and then on . The score should have been 8 - 2 if it weren ' t for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall ( bastard !). He ' s the reason the score was as close . Habs winning goal was scored by Benoit Brunet at 1 : 07 of the 3rd . Roy had an OK game .

Some people speculated that he just couldn ' t get himself back together after the incident , and I think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward .

       " 'So far Simmons looks like a total idiot . 1 ) Zane Smith should learn how to \" switchpitch \" and return from the DL . I would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all . 2 ) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an impressive win last week . NOw Otto \\' s latest debacle has restored Simmon \\' s reputation . Now he looks like he is back in his \\' 92 form when he had the AL \\' s highest ERA among starters . Four our sake ( not Ted \\' s sake ), I hope he pitches with a 3 . 5 ERA for the rest of the season . Yeah , right . 3 ) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing . They are still doing decently . BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons , they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse . Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters . Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year . He showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year . 4 ) Walk : Well , he seems to be on the losing end tonight . BUt I still think that Walk desrved his contract . 5 ) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation . I can \\' t understand his and management \\' s fear of losing Tom Prince through waivers . Even if they do , what \\' s the use . He is aright hander like Slaught . Not a very smart platoon . Also , I am blaming Leyland in this case , since he is hcurrently convinced that LaVAlliere is through , while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs ( SLaught should have played in all 7 games ; he has a good average against right handed pitching ). Didn \\' t Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year , and attempt to trade LaValliere last year itself ? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere wasn \\' t very fit last year . 6 ) Dennis MOeller is SCARY !!! 7 ) Candeleria : Well , he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the season . Maybe it will be in 3 - 4 range . BUt $ 1 million plus ? Come on . Other than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks , Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year . So far , he seems to have pitched well for the Rangers . I think the PIrates should have spent the money on Patterson in stead . 8 ) The Rookie batters : Well , Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact . Other than that , their excellent performance hasn \\' t been too much of a surprise . I think we should thank Doughty for that . 9 ) Rookie Pitchers : Worse than expected , especially Cooke . 10 ) Slaught : How come he wasn \\' t given a contract extension last year ? NOw his value has increased immensely . 11 ) Lonnie Smith !! Well , Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount . Let \\' s see . Eric can hit better . He can run better . He can field better . Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis . An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Smith . Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year , he won \\' t be an asset . He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field . 12 ) Management : BIG BIG ZERO . Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing . He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay . 13 ) Alex Cole fiasco . The PIrates infield and CF positions look good . The RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace two of the four outfielders . Eric Davis , Van Slyke and Cole would have made a very respectable outfield . Even without Eric Davis , thye PIrates would have a respectable outfield with Cole , SVan Slyke , and Merced ( I think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting ). Simmons did have options for the outfield . Ironically , the biggest accomplishment of Simmon \\' s tenure was getting Alex Cole really cheap . Too bad . 14 ) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds : Forget it . The pirates can rant and rave . they will not get those picks . As of now , the issue is still being appealed . Now , if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots , nothing else will . On a final note . Tim Wakefield won \\' t be as awful as he was in his last 2 starts . BUt don \\' t count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season . Also , if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season , they will miss Redus \\' s clutch hitting and his speed ( he has peaked in the second half of the last 2 seasons )>',\n",
       " 'Take a look at the standings . It \\' s REAL easy to get so focussed on minutinae and forget that the Giants happen to be in first place . If it \\' s working , you don \\' t SCREW IT UP by changing things , just because you think it ought to be different . Some folks like to argue about theoretical details . I prefer to watch teams win . When the Giants slip to third , then we can talk about how to re - arrange the batting order . Until then , I think it \\' s stupid to focus on what \\' s wrong , for the simple fact that IT \\' S WORKING AS IT IS . In the majors ? I don \\' t follow AL , so I won \\' t comment on \" Majors \". In the NL , if I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team , it \\' d be Clark , and I \\' d hit him third . ( My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it , because I \\' ve never been able to GET Clark . I \\' d take any of the three without hesitation in real life , but I think Clark is it ). Williams : Not even close . I much prefer his defense , but when he isn \\' t headcasing it , Matt has a good , solid swing and some real punch . If he drops to . 230 , then he wanders out of cleanup , but according to the latest Baseball Weekly , he \\' s hitting . 275 , and in the last week , hitting . 296 . That \\' s not exactly chopped liver . Mostly , though , the Giants are winning , and frankly , as long as that continues , it \\' s rather silly to second - guess their strategy .

       " \"While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory , I think it must be realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis Joseph . When a goalkeeper gets hot , there is little an opposing team can do . Joseph should be given the entire city of St . Louis , because otherwise there would probably be a game 6 scheduled . As for the game on Sunday . The Blues caught a few breaks , without a doubt . One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks , looking for reasons to give them penalties . Second , The Blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear . No linesman , no shot for Brett ( I can redirect anything ) Hull to redirect . On another of St . Louis ' goals , Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who didn ' t belong in the crease , which means it was a St . Louis player . Finally , the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease . No goalie , no way to stop the shot . I congratulate St . Louis for beating the Hawks . It will be a shame to see Bryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph won ' t be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack . ____________________________________________________________________________\",\n",

Then he casually leaned against his bat . I don ' t blame the umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch . The worst part of the whole incident was the Braves coming out onto the field . What were they going to do , attack the umpire ? The only people who should ' ve been out there were Cox and maybe the coaches , but NO players .

But you * surely * remember my shout of relief when , after a week of rumors that Morris was coming to the Red Sox , they ended up with Viola instead . Now I ' m even happier . Viola seems to have rebounded nicely . How long did Viola sign for . Three years ? I generally agree with their policy of avoiding long - term contracts for pitchers . But I think they enforce it rather too strictly . These days the premier pitchers all sign three or four year deals . Which leaves the Jays with Morris and Stewart . If the Jays want to compete for top free agent pitchers , they will have to accept greater risks . Any idea what the option year deal is for Morris ? Are there any automatic activation clauses ?

       " 'A - hem . Two words : Russell Davis . Playing in the cavern at Albany ( AA ) last year ( 375 / 410 / 385 down the alleys and to center ), Davis went . 285 /. 355 /. 483 with 22 homers . There aren \\' t any small parks on the road in the Eastern League , either . He \\' s 23 (!) and his MLE was . 258 /. 308 /. 416 , 17 HR . I have no fielding statistics , but from seeing him a number of times last year I \\' d say that he \\' s not Brooks Robinson , but neither is he Howard Johnson . Unless they think they can win the pennant * this year * ( which seems possible ) and need Boggs to do it , I think they \\' re making the same sort of mistake with Davis that Boston made with Boggs , leaving him in the minors for two or three years after he \\' d shown that he was a good hitter . Hrm ? They still have him on the roster ( 16 AB through the first two weeks ). They \\' ve just never figured out what to do with him . I suspect that he hits enough ( especially vs . lefties ) to be a reasonable shortstop . One rumor running around during spring training was that they wanted to convert Silvestri to be a catcher (!) because \" his body type was wrong for a shortstop \".

Trottier was given a major . But Roger , what the hell does this have to do with Gainey ' s skill as a hockey player ? If Probert smashes Gilmour ' s head into the boards next week , will that diminish your assessment of Gilmour ' s skills ? I would take Fuhr and Sanderson off of the latter . I think Gainey would be honoured to know that you ' ve included him on this list . I also think you have a relatively naive view about what wins a hockey game ... pluggers are an integral part of any team . The Selke is designed to acknowledge their contribution ...

Quebec ' s powerplay is lethal and it is to their advantage to have a penalty - filled game where they can clean up with their superior powerplay . Montreal really lost that game ( and game 2 ) because Patrick Roy is well on his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs . The man is truly overrated .

       " \"The Sharks appear to be leaning toward picking Rob Niedermayer , a center ( his brother Scott (?) is a defenseman picked by NJ a couple years ago ). They brought him in for a physical / tryout a week or so ago . From what I have read Niedermayer is the best skater in the draft , plays BOTH offense and defense , and isn ' t afraid of physical play . Defensively the Sharks are looking pretty good in terms of defense prospects ( Rathje , Sykora , Ragnarsson ), and our centers ( Kisio et al ) are getting old .

       " 'I AM an Ulf ( and Pgh ) fan , and what pisses me off about the whole Adam Graves / Ulf Samuesson debate is that Ulf plays hard - hitting hockey ( nothing wrong with that ) while Graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to intentionally hurt someone ( which bites !). I thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this season to stop crap like that ?!? Is it just me , or does the officiating just still stink to high heaven ? IMHO , if they could get rid of the existing refs , and institute a new system with more than one ref on the ice to keep an eye on the trouble - makers then a lot of these things would stop , and then the game would be ruled by the finnesse players : Mario , Selanne , Bure , Messier , et . al ...',\n",

       " \"The Giants always hit Maddux well , but it was interesting that Maddux did not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night . He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night , got away with the first one , but Bonds hit the second one out of the park . Then in the 3rd , when Clark was at third base with one out , Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds , and Bonds dropped a single to left - center . The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet . He will always hit around . 300 , but I ' m concerning about his on - base percentage . The key in the lineup is Matt Williams , he has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base . The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL . Burba has done a superb job filling in so far , he looks like a different pitcher from last year . However , Swift is terrible in both of his starts . With Burba moving into the rotation , Mike Jackson is the only right - handed reliever aside from Rod Beck , he ' ll get a lot of actions . I also hope that Dusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig , especially on Beck . I was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week . So far so good !\",\n",
       " '^^ Funny you should mention it ... this is exactly the case I was going to make . I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans , even if the team sucks . But this is short term only ; I still do not think the attendance increase will last , unless the team is a winning / competitive / improving / butt - kicking one . Pittsburgh was still getting better , so people continued to support them . If they suddenly dropped to , say , 50 points , you \\' d have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon . Ok . My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book . You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it . But my point is that it wasn \\' t Mario himself , but it was the * expectation * of things to come ( i . e . a winning team ) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar . And before anybody jumps in and says I \\' m nit - picking and mincing words , go back and read from where this thread started ... It might help to think about what would go through a fan \\' s mind who suddenly found an interest in Mario and the Pens . Was it \" gee , Mario Lemieux is amazing , I \\' ll go watch him play \", or was it \" gee , now we \\' ve got a * kick * * ass * guy on * our * side , I \\' ll go watch him play \". I think it was the latter . I don \\' t think this is accurate . The * tickets * sell , but people don \\' t go to the games . I think this thread has already been discussed ... season ticket holders in LA don \\' t always use their tickets . So in effect , after the Kings initial success following Gretzky \\' s arrival ( 68 to 91 points , same source ) and corresponding attendance jump , there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much . Whether or not the Kings are a \\' winner \\' is debatable . I claim that since Gretzky \\' s arrival they have at the very least been competitive ... I also claim that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler dynasty ... but that \\' s another story and included only because I don \\' t like McNall :-). Anyway , McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky , and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales , etc . But as I said , when the Kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the Forum even if the tickets were sold . For the short term , IMO . Although I think that it \\' s inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky , simply because they make people around them better . Well , at least we are in full agreement here ! So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point ? < couldn \\' t resist ...> Yes , but they are doing no worse than last year . I think the same type of reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at Winnipeg games . It \\' s difficult to predict , but do you think that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels ? I seriously doubt it , because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone , with or without Selanne .',\n",

It was part of their preseason special . Basically , they looked at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances ( or ABs ) by the time they were 24 , and noticed some interesting things . For starters , they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game . They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame . The kicker , though , was that they actually did some number - crunching and found that such players ' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group . They also found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals ( HRs , etc ) of the other players . The first group outhit the second something like . 282 to . 260 in raw BA , and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs , 2Bs , RBIs , etc .

       " 'The problem with your nihilistic approach , Roger , is that it takes all the sense out of the game . By your line of reasoning , if a guy hits into a double play with one out and the bases loaded , there \\' s no point in saying that that was a bad thing to do ( if his team won anyway ) or speculating on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise , so the double play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was eventually won or lost for unknown reasons . After all , any speculation involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn \\' t . Roger , do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead ? Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence ? Teams go to the post - season when they win more games than anybody else in their division . If they don \\' t make the post - season , they don \\' t win the Series . Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ring - collecting ? If so , you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal towards winning the division , and our disagreements come when we consider how to win games . In your viewpoint as expressed , winning games happens for reasons that cannot be analyzed . While many of us are thinking things like \" Base - runners are good , outs are bad , and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded \", you are thinking things like \" It \\' s a team game , so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today \". The result is that it becomes impossible to say * anything * about individual players . Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing left field . After all , perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it . Therefore , I could be an extremely valuable player . Did Dave Winfield have anything to do with the Jays \\' victory ? Probably , but how do you know ? If you replace him with Andres Galarraga , perhaps the Jays would have won , perhaps they would have lost , perhaps they would have defected to Alpha Centauri ( bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in mid - season had Winfield been DHing for Toronto ). Was Babe Ruth a good player ? He played on some WS - winning teams , but did he have anything to do with their success ? It is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player , and Jarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder weren \\' t . It seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof . Now , we have observed things about baseball over the years , both empirically and by looking at the rulebook . It is necessary to score more runs than one \\' s opponent to win the game , so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent one \\' s opponent from scoring . Runs are scored while a team is batting , and an inning ends after the third out , so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good . Players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels , and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year . We do use these statistics to predict winners , and so do you . To make some flat predictions : Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP + SLG than Gene Larkin this year . The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies in the standings . The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals , but will also give up more . I would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false , and , I suspect , so would you . As a matter of fact , I am pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year , given 3 - 4 guesses per division , and this is certainly better than random chance ( and almost statistically significant ). If you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet in the World Series , you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods , however fuzzy . So how about \" real life \"? Person A robs a service station with two people in it , using a . 38 automatic pistol , gets $ 42 , and is convicted and sentenced for three years . Person B , with a similar criminal record , robs a service station with two people in it , using a . 38 revolver , gets $ 42 , and is convicted . Since they used two different types of handgun , are comparisons totally meaningless ? Say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works ( my cats are always testing this - they don \\' t trust me to pay the gravity bill on time ). You have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before , so all previous evidence is meaningless ? Or would you be surprised if it flew out the window instead of hitting the desk ?',\n",
       " 'Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate , with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times . My opinion , FWIW , to all : Mark , age doesn \\' t matter ; ability does . I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best . I don \\' t care if he is 15 ; if he plays better than what I have , I want him out there . Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers , grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular ; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter ( which is good for a catcher , I \\' ll admit ). Santiago \\' s numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy \\' s , but I don \\' t have the league data from the mid - 80s to check it out . That being said , I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond , at least to start the season . As the box below shows , he has * one * minor league season in which he hit well . He has two in which he hit very , very poorly . I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real . Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities ; for catchers , especially NL catchers , they are essentially average hitters , with equivalent averages around . 220 . If he had hit well at prior levels , I would say he belongs on the Braves ; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87 . One year at any level , at any age , doesn \\' t satisfy MY standards of evidence .

But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play ; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates ; and at a still young age ( 24 ), had a monster year with an 868 OPS . He has a total , major and minor , EQA of . 249 ; above major league average , and above average for CF ( which was about . 240 in the NL last year ). He has shown at least the potential of going into the . 290s , which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league . He has two full seasons before reaching his \" prime \" season of 27 .

       " \"The same Bill James ? Why do you say that ? It sounds like you ' re suggesting Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death . Au contraire ; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign , noting that he wasn ' t all - world as a catcher or a hitter . He called him basically average when everyone * else * in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella . Which reports are those ? I like Hernandez a lot , but if Piazza can catch the ball , you ' ve gotta play him IMHO . He ' s a much better hitter , although Hernandez isn ' t a * bad * hitter . Right now , it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti ' s caddy since he can catch the knuckler . As long as they play up to their abilities , the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem . I think both are overrated defensively ( see Nichols ' Law of catcher defense ), but that ' s something that ' s difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine . About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent ' s SB %, and that ' s clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners . Catchers ERA is a possibility , but it ' s subject to way too many biases . As for them ' playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat ', I disagree here too . About the only chink in the Braves ' armor is that they ' re weak offensively at several positions ( CF , C , 2B , SS if Belliard plays , 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super - platoon ) and very weak defensively if Blauser plays . I ' d like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves , Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot , but much like the talent - rich Jays of recent years they ' ll be conservative and stick with what they have . I ' m not saying that ' s wrong , just conservative .\",\n",

There may have been some game considerations that might have prompted Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later . But the game * was * on the line , and Samuel never did get in .

       " 'Sorry , Sherri , but I can \\' t agree with this particular incident . While I \\' m all for cutting down the number of chain - rattles and other examples of rampant Hargroving , there was a difference here . 1 ) Since time immemorial , batters have complained about calls . So have pitchers and catchers . Usually , nothing happens . Unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing complaints , Hirschbeck was acting against expectations . 2 ) It \\' s not as if Gant was \" in Hirschbeck \\' s face \". Gant said something about the call , stepped out of the box , and turned away from Hirschbeck . As a hitter ( alibet of little consequence , but with a decent eye ), whenever receiving the short end of the stick on a questionable call , I \\' d want a moment or two out of the box , if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on the experience of the last pitch . And if I was really angry at the ump , I \\' d rather turn away and catch my breath than turn to him and say something that might get me tossed , especially at a key moment in the game . When Gant turned away , Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant to step into the box . IMO , at this point in time , Hirschbeck was determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game . Gant wasn \\' t dawdling ; he hadn \\' t had a chance to dawdle . And Hirschbeck was simply exercising a power play . Gant resisted , as many of us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request , and Hirschbeck called for the pitch . At that point , Cox came out on the field , the pitch was thrown , and many other Braves left the dugout . Cox was tossed \" protecting his player \". I was pleasantly surprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game . It \\' s a small sample size , but based on what I saw in that game , Mark Hirschbeck has a hair - trigger temper and a need to play God on the field . Not good qualities for an umpire . I will keep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the future , in order to improve my sample size . IMO , any game where you remember the name of the umpire was a bad game for the umpire .',\n",

Answers to some frequently asked questions : Q : Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs ?

       " 'As the heading indicates , it is impossible for me to fathom why Barry is not batting 4th for the Giants behind Will Clark . Barry is such an awesome and consistent hitter -- definitely the best in the National League . IMHO , to have Williams , a streaky hitter ( and not really a clutch hitter ) batting 4th ahead of Bonds is simply an injustice to the Giants and fans of the Giants .',\n",

       " 'Finns had to do their best last night when they played against Norway in world champs . After two periods the score was still 0 - 0 . This game was quite much similar to the first game Finland played ( against France ). The norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky , too . In the third period Juha Riihij { rvi scored 1 - 0 from a rebound , the time was around 5 mins or so . The second goal was scored by Kari Harila , who shot straight from a faceoff behind the Nowwegian goalie . Saku Koivu , the 18 - year - old center got his first point of this tournament . Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and he was awarded the best player of the game - prize . Despite the fact that he is quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater . I think that we will hear from this guy in the future .',\n",
       " \"But , THEY FACED THE PHILLIES -- A TEAM THAT GOT OFF TO AN 8 - 1 START . To be honest , I think the city of Houston loves the new owner . He has brought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players that were from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros . I don ' t think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team as he has already admitted that he doesn ' t know a whole lot about baseball . McLane is a businessman , and doesn ' t like excuses . He makes a valid point that injuries shouldn ' t be an excuse to this club . Look at the depth of the bench this season .. Canadele can play 7 positions ; Bass and James are solid outfielders and can hit well too ; Uribe is nice to have as well .. The pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters . We ' re dealing with a young Houston team , so injuries shouldn ' t play a big role . The only threat is the bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out , we may be in trouble but with the type of starters we have this season , there is less pressure on the pen .\",\n",
       " 'the owners are whining about baseball not being popular among a large enough portion of the population , and have suggested various \" remedies \", such as shortening the game or trying to convince us that \" smoke \\' embake \\' emdominatebysheerintimidation \" is an accurate description of what is , essentially , a laid - back game . forget those lame ideas . here is my new and exciting two - point plan to generate interest in baseball among the masses . point one : sex . point two : violence . let \\' s face it , sex and violence are the only things that sell in america . here \\' s how we can implement them in the game : sex : cheerleaders , cheerleaders , and more cheerleaders . dancing on top of the dugouts . bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh inning stretch . running up and down the stands . ( the south bend white sox actually do this ). violence : baseball players are such utter wuss boys . the pitcher beans the batter , and both benches empty in what is called a \" bench - clearing brawl \". EVERYBODY JUST STANDS THERE AND LOOKS AT EACH OTHER . stand , stand , stand . look , look , look . ho , hum . then , the bullpens come running in . when they reach the \" fight \", they just stand there , too . anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch should be suspended and fined . further , the bullpens should fight it out in the outfield , so as not to waste time and energy running to the infield . football : sex , violence . basketball : sex , violence . hockey : violence . baseball : \" da pastime of da nayshun !\" - yawn .',\n",
       " \"-- Minnesota definitely deserves an NHL franchise !!! You ' ll see the Minnesota Whalers pretty soon , so fear not Minnesota fans .

       " \"Exactly my point . If you ' d watch games more closely , you ' d see a lot of goons going after him . Ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical players for Pgh are left alone . Ulf plays rough hockey , but only when other players are putting the rush on Mario or Jagr . If you want to say anyone on the Penguins is a cheap shot or a goon , say it ' s Jennings or Caufield . Don ' tslander a good defenseman because your favorite players can ' t beat the Pens even when they take dives ( like Gartner ) to try for the cheap penalties . Hey , that ' s fine ! If a player does something stupid , he should be penalized including Ulf . Or Mario ( you ' re not likely to see that happen ) or anyone else for that matter . It ' s pointless to say any one person is a cheap - shot goon , because you ' ll see EVERYONE take a cheap shot now and then , especially if you ' resomeone who is shadowed as much as Ulf is .\",\n",
       " \"Detroit is a very disciplined team . There ' s a lot of Europeans in Detroit which would make the game fast , so Toronto would have to slow the game down , which means drawing penalties , as a last resort anyway . Toronto will be a good team as soon as they get more good players . Toronto is just an average team , Detroit isn ' t Ballard screwed Toronto when he was owner . Everyone knows that . and it ' s going to take time for Toronto to become a real force . I expect Gilmour to be burnt out next year . He can ' t pull the whole team forever .\",\n",
       " \"Hi . According to my always questionable newspaper , there ' s a silver dollar being minted in Canada , the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the Stanley Cup . Now , I know full well what coins are used every day in Canada . I can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now , in fact . My question is , since the loon is the only dollar coin that I know is legal tender , is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value , or what ? Is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet , with no chance of it being circulated ? If it is an uncirculated coin , what ' s the current cost and what ' s its potential value ? Just curious . If no one knows , I ' ll take this to soc . culture . canada and rec . collecting ( or whatever it is ). Thanks again\",\n",

       " 'Whatever you say . I think it \\' s just 12 games into the season myself , so I \\' m going to wait a bit before calling names . I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher , and I have no idea why Simmons ever wanted him . On the other hand , I expect him to release Otto if he doesn \\' t turn things around pretty fast . ( BTW , Otto \\' s game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22 , which points out a problem with the method since Otto \\' s performance was infinitely bad , and excruciatingly prolonged .) I think Merced \\' s rookie year was a bit flukey , but aren \\' t you willing to give him some more at bats ( and Tomlin a few more starts ) before acting so gloomy ? No he didn \\' t . Walk is a time bomb . He has no stuff whatsoever , and when the league finally realizes this , it won \\' t be pretty at all . Don \\' t be so fast . Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele , which was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors . Meanwhile , I \\' m not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a six - year free agent before the 1992 season . Twice through the rotation , and you \\' ve given up ? Yikes . But so has his age , at least in baseball terms . The useful half - life of a 34 - year - old injury - prone catcher can \\' t be much longer than a year . But he wanted to be a Dodger , and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous 1992 . I don \\' t think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign him . He certainly wasn \\' t last year . Hey , that \\' s the \" Skates Smith \" package deal . Anybody who acquires Lonnie for his defense or base - running ( particularly at this stage ) is a real weirdo . If that \\' s the goal of the team ownership , than I don \\' t see why Sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy . I don \\' t know what he has or hasn \\' t said about revenue sharing , so I can \\' t comment there . It \\' s annoying , but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain Jeff King , it was probably unavoidable . Meanwhile , I think bigger accomplishments of Simmons \\' tenure were getting some value for John Smiley , not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year , drafting well in 1992 , letting the rookies show something in 1993 . Foley , Smith , and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts , which means that even if fail it hasn \\' t done serious damage to the Bucs \\' future . Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case ? I never heard the outcome of this . When will the final verdict be in on this ? I \\' m not sure who was the idiot in this case , so I don \\' t know who to blame . It might have been Doug Danforth , after all . In fact , I * seriously * suspect it was Doug Danforth , who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his feet .

I would guess that a tiny fraction of 1 % of the folks reading your post agree with it . I kind of doubt that even you agree with it . I ' m not going to go through your points one at a time , because , after all , not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball . I ' m only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema , the AAA umpire who sued ( is suing ?) baseball on the grounds of sex discrimination because she wasn ' t promoted to the majors . I ' ve never seen her ump a game . I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire . But I have seen her on talk shows . And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most . It seems to me that she is missing the point and if that ' s how she sees the role of umpires in the game , well I wouldn ' t promote her either . The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out ; hell , Joe Lundy could do that . Their primary function is to maintain order in the game , keep the game moving , and keep the players from trying to kill each other . Umpires have to be extremely tough people . That disqualifies most of us , both men and women . And if Ms . Postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook , then I think that disqualifies her as well . Umpires need to command the game ; command of the rulebook is secondary .\",\n",

The Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC ( ch 9 ) in Windsor where we see Don Cherry ' s Coaches Corner between periods .

Personally , I ' ve had my fill of Donny ! He really pisses me off sometimes . During the Detroit - Toronto game Monday night on CBC , Don gave high praise to Doug Gilmour , saying he was a two - way player and not just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player in the game because of that . That ' s fine and I agree that Gilmour is a good two - way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman about a month ago on a local radio talk show . What gives ? It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from city to city . Don Cherry : ' I think < insert star player name for city that he is in > is the best two - way player in the league today .'

Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario Lemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs from the Civic Center ( Yes , I think the Pens will make it out of the Wales Conference ) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about Lemieux .

When he was up 6 - 1 in a ballgame , he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters \" get themseleves out \" ( I hate this expression !). An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down . But Morris , being a veteran pitcher , knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball . By saving himself , he was able to reach back for that little extra ( I hate this too !) when the game was on the line . Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year , but let \\' s not change history to suit the present .

It \\' s an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears , the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House . I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship . And we \\' re glad to have them here . I \\' m inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship , but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory . Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size , but also filled with pride and tradition and community , I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears . In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team , and that was back in 1978 . I \\' m sure that 15 years from now , the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today . You know , in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey . We don \\' t have a lot of ice . ( Laughter .) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town , I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here . Hockey is a tough game . It \\' s a hard - hitting sport . It does have one virtue though , there \\' s a penalty for delay of game . I wish we had that rule in the Senate . ( Laughter .) In government as in hockey , leadership is important . In the United States Senate , our team has a great captain , the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine , George Mitchell ; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young , I can \\' t imagine . ( Laughter .) I \\' m actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me . On your hockey team , the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job . He scored the winning goal late in the championship game , leading you to a come - from - behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about . Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities . I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team , how to bring out the best in one another , and how to come from behind . I think it \\' s important , as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together , to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country , to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives . We now have another role model , and I \\' m glad to have them here today . ( Applause .) ( The President is presented with team jersey .) ( Applause .) THE PRESIDENT : That \\' s great . I love it . It \\' s beautiful . ( Applause .) ( The President is presented with an autographed stick .) THE PRESIDENT : Thank you . That \\' s great . ( Applause .) * * * * * * Q Mr . President , did you authorize the move on Waco this morning , sir ? THE PRESIDENT : I was aware of it . I think the Attorney General made the decision . And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI . Q Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed ? THE PRESIDENT : No , they made the tactical decisions . That was their judgment , the FBI . Q Is this a raid ? THE PRESIDENT : And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI . I knew it was going to be done , but the decisions were entirely theirs , all the tactical decisions . Q What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning ? Q Any chance for that stimulus package ? THE PRESIDENT : Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter . ( Laughter .) I was in there -- ( laughter ). SENATOR MITCHELL : You have to pay that quarter . THE PRESIDENT : I was ready . ( Laughter .) Senator Mitchell , he \\' s worth a quarter any day . Q Any chance for your bill , sir ? THE PRESIDENT : We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we \\' re going to have for the rest of the week . We only had about five minutes to talk . And we agreed we \\' d get back together later , around noon , and talk some more . Q Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise . THE PRESIDENT : Well , I know he did , but , look , Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983 ; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $ 100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President , in those administrations . And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work . I don \\' t want to go back and revisit every one , but you can do it . You can look at the research there . So this position they \\' re taking is not credible . We have a very tough five - year deficit reduction plan . All these costs are covered during that time and then some . And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don \\' t have much of a history on which to base their position . They \\' ve got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work . So I think we \\' ve got a chance to work it out , and I \\' m hopeful . We \\' ll see what happens today and tomorrow . I \\' m feeling pretty good about it . THE PRESS : Thank you END 10 : 10 A . M . EDT - 30 -',\n",

This telecast will primarily seen on the East Coast . St . Louis at Chicago - Mike Emrick ( play - by play ), Jim Schoendfeld ( color ) and Tom Mees roaming the halls . This telecast will primarily be seen in the Midwest and parts of the South . LA at Calgary - Al \" Do You Believe in Mircales ?\" Michaels ( play by play ), John Davidson ( color ) and Mark Jones as a roaming reporter . This telecast will be seen in the Western USA . Montreal \\' s naitive , Jon Saunders will be hosting in the studio . ABC will do \" Up and Close and Personal \" with Mario during Saturday \\' s Wide World of Sports ( 4 : 30EDT ). Sunday will be the first NHL playoff or regular network telecast in 13 years ... not counting those silly All - Star games on NBC for the last few years ... For Sunday \\' s games , ABC will use 8 mikes ( 2 behind on the goal ), super - super - slo - mo , close - ups of player \\' s faces at face - offs . ESPN / ABC will not be able to use its new favorite toy , the ice - level shot , in Pittsburgh where too many seats would have to removed to employ it ... In case of a blowout in progress in Pittsburgh , ABC will switch to Chicago game but will come back to the Pittsburgh game for updates or if the game gets closer ( Ha !).. ABC expects huge ratings ( by hockey standards ) since all 3 Top US TV - markets are involved - NY metro area ( NY Islanders / NJ Devils ), Chicago ( BlackHawks ), and LA ( Kings ). Stay tuned , Thanks Mike ,',\n",

       " \"I watched the final inning of Bosio ' s no - hitter with several people at work . After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle , someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove , he wouldn ' t have had time to throw Riles out . Yet , the throw beat Riles by about two steps . I wonder how many others who watched the final out think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand . Does anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded ? And if he failed to field it cleanly , would it ( or should it ) have been an error or a hit ? ( Judging from Bosio ' s grimace when the ball bounced past him , he must have thought it would go through for a hit .) Whether Vizquel was right or wrong , he certainly made one hell of a play . -- -------------------------- Phil Brown | aka pb6755 @ csc . albany . edu |\",\n",

       " \": Hi there , : : I ' m german and I have been into this MLB stuff since almost one year now . : There are many problems occuring for me . One of them is the ERA statistic for : pitchers . What does it say ?? ERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game . Thus , if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned run , his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs , thus his ERA is 3 . 00 . To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9 . ERA = ( ER / IP ) * 9 An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error . More specifically , if an error occurs that represented the third out , all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs . Earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game . Here are some examples : If there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base . If an error occurs that represents the third out , all of the runs after this error and NOT counted as earned runs . If a pitcher issues some base on balls ( walks ), and leaves the game before the inning is completed , he is responsible for the people who were left on base . If the those runners who were left on base score , and the score was not a result of an error , those eraned runs are attributed to the pitcher who left the game . I hope this explains things for you .\",\n",

       " 'Mark Singer brings up the Strawberry Incident , where he lost a homerun and the fan caught it . Yes , I think he should have done more to get out of the way . As much as fans want to catch a ball , they really should be aware that winning the game is more important . As a Dodger fan , he has to be aware that this is the home stadium , and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible . As soon as the ball was hit that far , his first instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it , not to try to catch it himself , particularly when he is sitting that close . I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans , where they are against visiting team home runs so much , they actually throw them back on the field . Now , this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or not . Sure , he probably screwed up , but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win .',\n",

       " \"It was unlikely , improbable . For the Bruins , it was the stuff of nightmares ; for the Sabres , it was a taste of heaven . For the first time since 1983 , the Sabres have won the first three games of a series . Last time was a three games to none victory in a best of five against the Canadiens . It takes a little more work this time . The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work . On the heels of a shutout , one that took away Boston ' s home ice advantage , the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win . It wasn ' t easy . It wasn ' t always pretty . It still worked . John Blue got the nod for Boston , supplanting Andy Moog as starting goaltender . Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday . Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny , his fourth of the playoffs , on the powerplay , with Boston ' s Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box . LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists . Goal number two was Khmylev ' s first of the playoffs , a pretty goal scored when the Sabres stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev . Smehlik and Hannan assisted . Determined not to be shut out , Boston tallied on a shot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay , with Colin Patterson and Bob Sweeney both in the box . Period two was scoreless , a split of penalties between the two clubs . The third saw Boston ' s Smolinski get his first , courtesy of Oates . Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes later , from former Bruin Bob Sweeney ( Khmylev and Carney ). Neely tied the game 3 / 4 of the way through the third , sending it into overtime . Last year overtime meant a Bruin win . Last night , it spelled sweet revenge , as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box , on a tip in by Khmylev ( Hawerchuk and LaFontaine ) a minute into overtime . Both teams finished with 34 shots . Power - play conversions -- Boston 5 - 1 . Buffalo 7 - 2 . Referee -- Rob Shick . Comments : Shick pocketed the whistle in the third , allowing a lot of clutching and grabbing . Buffalo ' s penalty killing unit was fantastic again . Mogilny was checking . Granted he missed once and instead flung his body into the boards , but checking like this is a novel idea to Mogilny . The crowd was unbelievable . I don ' t think I ' ve ever heard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game ( remember , I was only five when they played for the cup . I don ' t remember it and no one took me to the games ). Doug Bodger , in a postgame interview , noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk , but the crowd was too loud , even though he was shouting . It didn ' t seem to matter , as most of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great . Yuri Khmylev didn ' t seem to realize that he was the game ' s third star and didn ' t skate out when his name was called . Sweeney ( 2 ) and Fuhr ( 1 ) each were out before Yuri made his appearance , sans jersey . When asked in an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was , he responed yes ( ok , it was through an interpreter and he said more than that , even more than the interpreter said , but I digress ). The interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn ' t speak English , he must not understand playoffs . Uh - huh .\",\n",

In the biology context , we would very likely read \" fitness \" for \" the score of the game \" and \" organisms \" for \" teams \". How we interpret \" players \" is trickier , but either \" organs \", or \" genes \" might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make . A \" genes \" interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case , but that would be a different and probably longer post . If , however , we take the \" organ \" view , then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like \" species X is more fit than species Y because of a better organ Z \". Given what we know about the interdependence of organs , we would often be suspicious of such claims . ( But note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map \" species X \" onto \\' humans \\', and \" organ Z \" onto \\' brain \\'). On the other hand , some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others , as far as we can test them ( e . g . \\' brain \\' above might be more reasonable than \\' pancreas \\' assuming no gross pathology , particularly if species Y is a primate ). Even when you make such statements , you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism , and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another . ( Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species .) However , if we are non - vitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak , we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable \" whole \" but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable . Some of these processes might be localized to particular organs , while others may be distributed across multiple organs . In a way , this is just like a baseball team , except that I think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are * much * simpler and less numerous than in most organisms . One thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do . But , of course , this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can , and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty . Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation , but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research . In this cases , we \\' re seeing the word \" statistics \" means \" summary of observed events \", where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process , and possibly inputs for other processes . Thus , if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism , data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses . This statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again . Fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment ; you might be fit in one situation and not another . Moving to baseball , it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league . In at least a nominal sense , the division winners are the fittest teams in the league , in that they ( on average ) had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts . But in a real sense , there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to ( or interesting for ) baseball . The same is true in biology . But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the World Series in basebal . In the world series , the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played , and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful . It might be fun to watch , but it \\' s unclear what it all really means . *** Now just one more un - related point : On the other hand , you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes , and maybe some of us ( e . g . me ) who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis . But this is probably only due to the fact that a 162 - game schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops aren \\' t the only difference between the winners and the losers . Moreover , you \\' ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World Series situation that makes the strong claim that * nobody * can predict the WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the well - known home vs . road effect on winning percentage . Since stats are summaries of events , it \\' s true that if you know the events you can derive the stats . But if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats , then the stats produce new knowledge , and some of this might even be reliable , repeatable , and useful . Speaking of which , I should get back to producing knowledge in a different field . That is , of course , if I can produce knowledge even though I \\' m relying on stats to do it .',\n",
       " 'Sigh . Here we go again . Must I ? If I were to say that batting average is a predictor that can be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a hit on a particular plate appearance , is that only valid if I can define the skill in hitting a baseball ? That \\' s all I \\' ve said , except I used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations . I did not say I could predict the future . I \\' ve suggested that the statistic is not necessarily meaningless . Here \\' s the data for this situation : Non - Clutch Clutch AB H BA AB H BA Sabo 1539 452 . 294 259 59 . 228 Samuel 1564 383 . 245 278 83 . 299 If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time , I assume you would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch - hitting Samuel . I \\' m sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance . You just wouldn \\' t have used this particular aspect of prior performance . Is this not correct ? One more time . I did * not * claim to be able to predict the future . I said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would have had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo . And I am not dismissing your work . I \\' m stating my opinion . You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid , so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work . I did not say that clutch - hitting is well defined . I said that the data is significant to me . I did not say that it is a consistent skill . I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances . And , [ big sigh ] I have NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT EVER called you or anyone else on r . s . b . \" stupid \". It is nice , however , to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceived biases . Ah . I knew we could get to the name calling . And there \\' s that word you like so much . Wait a minute . I thought I first had to define clutch hitting . Do I , or don \\' t I ? I made two statements in my post . 1 . I am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting . 2 . I would have hit for Sabo . As for # 2 , many of us make a number of written statements through this media about what we think will happen in baseball . I \\' m not shy about it . I \\' ll make the statement again . I believe that by season \\' s end that Chris Sabo \\' s batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in non - clutch situations . I can \\' t prove that it will happen , so I guess we \\' ll just have to wait and see . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Here \\' s another one for you . In 1989 - 1991 Joe Carter \\' s batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in non - clutch situations each year . I presume you think this is random . Non - Clutch : 1585 AB 411 H . 259 Clutch : 338 AB 68 H . 201 So what could we expect in 1992 from Mr . Carter ? Well , his composite BA through 1989 was . 268 ; through 1990 was . 262 ; through 1991 was . 263 , so I think we have a pretty good idea of what kind of batting average he can produce . In 1992 he hit . 264 . Not surprising , huh ? Also in 1992 : Non - Clutch : 536 AB 144 H . 269 Clutch : 86 AB 20 H . 233 No , this doesn \\' t prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of major league ballplayers . It just makes me think that in 1993 Joe Carter \\' s batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in non - clutch situations . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - As for # 1 ( above ), I have plenty of company . John Dewan of STATS , INC . is the editor of The Scouting Report wherein the statistics regarding clutch hitting are compiled , reported and referenced in the text . Bill James makes numerous references to a player \\' s ability to hit well in the clutch . I am not saying that I can predict the future any more than they are . You ( and others ) are saying that your work renders their statements ( and mine ) meaningless .

       " 'I finally got it back , with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending it . # 2 ROB ZETTLER Season : 4th Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : C / C - Zettler gave the Sharks every bit he \\' s got this year ; unfortunately , this still wasn \\' t enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer , if that . He works hard , for sure , but is no better than average on defense , and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times , while being basically an offensive zero ( 0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games ). He would be hardpressed to make the team next year . # 3 DAVID WILLIAMS Season : 2nd Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , free agent from New Jersey Grade : C / C - IMO , Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in \\' 91 - 92 , playing a combination of good offense ( 3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games ) and good defense . But he , playing the first part of this season in Kansas City , was good neither offensively nor defensively this year ; it , then , appears that \\' 91 - 92 was a fluke . Although he improved towards the end of the season , he was prone to being out of position defensively , and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team \\' s leading scorer among defensemen last year . He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year . # 4 JAYSON MORE Season : 2nd Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , from Montreal in expansion draft Grade : B + After being touted as the team \\' s top defensive prospects in training camp before \\' 91 - 92 , More had a rather disappointing \\' 91 - 92 , as he was not particularly good defensively , and had just 17 points in 46 games . He , then , proceeded to improve his game massively this season , becoming the team \\' s most reliable defenseman , whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional ( but only occasional ) offensive flash . Offensively , he was even more disappointing than last year ( 11 points in 73 games ), but his defense improved tremendously . He is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman . # 5 NEIL WILKINSON Season : 4th Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : B - Wilkinson was probably the team \\' s top defensive defenseman in \\' 91 - 92 . However , partially because of injuries , he was not the same this year , as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries , and seemed to be slowed even when playing . He , then , had often to be saved by his defensive partners ; that is , if they are there at all . But he also had some solid games , and if he can be complete healthy , he can still be a force . # 6 SANDIS OZOLINSH Season : 1st Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , 2nd round pick in entry draft Grade : I ( A ) At the time of his injury ( December 30 , against the Philadelphia Flyers ), Ozolinsh was well on track to be , IMO , the team \\' s MVP . A serious knee injury in that game , though , forced him to miss the rest of the season ( 47 games ), but he still finished as the team \\' s top scorer among defensemen ( 23 points ), which , of course , tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from their defensemen , but it also tells of Ozolinsh \\' s abilities . At the time , he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense ; he was still susceptible to so - called \" rookie mistakes ,\" but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team , rookie or veteran . If he can come back from his injuries , he is ready to be a star . # 19 DOUG ZMOLEK Season : 1st Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : B Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year , being one of the only two Sharks to play in all 84 games of the season . He was solid on defense , but after being billed as an offensive defenseman , he didn \\' t show it ( 15 points ). He was also prone to penalties , and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team ; however , that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents , and he was at his best when playing physically . But to become a fixture in this league , he needs to improve both offensively and defensively , and cut down on the number of power - plays he gives to opponents .',\n",

I am not from Wisconsin , but I have close relatives who live in Port Washington ( about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee ), I visit the city regularly , and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals play and the NCAA Hockey Championships .

Very few fans real - istically expect the Kings to do well this year ( although I do ) and yet they still go out to see Gretzky . This is the marketing strategy - selling the game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and , notably , the NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman / McNall leadership is bringing to the league . They have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars . Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect examples of players that real fans know aren ' t worth a damn and yet , being benificiaries of marketing - oriented coaching strategies , have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer , the very fans the NHL wants to attract , that these players are indeed superstars .

       " 'There are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans . I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages . And of course , they would not appear nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time . Another thing that bothers me is the points system . Percentages , as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative . When I look at the NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand ( which is almost always the case ). Some will object to percentages , claiming perhaps , that it is an \" Americanization \" of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and whether it is \" American \" or not is irrelevant . Even if Orr couldn \\' t have contributed without the likes of Norris , you would have to agree that Norris couldn \\' t have contributed without the likes of Orr .

       " 'Oh , yeah . Dave Winfield -- marginal player . Guy didn \\' t hit a lick , had negligible power , was a crap fielder and had no staying power . Dave Winfield , now entering his ( I believe ) 20th big league season , is still a damn decent hitter . Admittedly , his defense has slipped a great deal , but in his prime , he had a powerful arm and great range . Take a look at the stats : I don \\' t know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players . Kingman was a one - dimension power hitter -- he couldn \\' t field , he ran like an anvil , hit for a low average ( though , if I remember right , his OBP wasn \\' t THAT hideous ...), and ( for those who consider such things important ) was a absolute - primo - dick . Eddie Murray ? Yup , only the best 1st baseman of the 80 \\' s . I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots , but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983 , it seems that he wasn \\' t overrated by the media . Lee Smith ? Hmmmm ... This one \\' s actually pretty close . He \\' s had a s solid , dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks ( Wrigley , Fenway ...). I \\' d have to take a closer look at the stats ( it \\' s been a while ), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber . You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers , simply racking up a lot of saves doesn \\' t mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch , too . Simply because Minnesota and Boston and ( for a month ) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one , the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves . No way should HomerMan be in the HOF , IMHO . Darrell Evans ? Nice career , actually a bit underrated ( kinda like Ted Simmons , IMHO ), but not a HOF \\' er . Lemme ask you this . Who the hell playing the game ISN \\' T marginal ? Now , wait a goddamn minute here . Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop . His defense was SO good that he \\' s won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves . Again , Gold Gloves are mediot - biased , and a good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie \\' s more recent awards , but usually , this is tempered by someone else in the early 80 \\' s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career . Ozzie \\' s offense , you ask ? Good OBP , great speed numbers , in a park which , for most of his career , depressed offense , admittedly , no power (\\' cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still , a definite asset offensively . Yount ? 3 , 000 hits , MVP at two different positions , uh - huh , a real stiff . His \\' 82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory , and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks , as far as SS numbers go . He \\' s a clear HOF \\' er , IMHO . Well , as far as Garvey goes , you \\' re right . Garvey is a \" mediot \" candidate , pushed because of his \" winning attitude \" ( a minor factor , if one at all ), and his \" great defense \" ( no errors , admittedly , but the range of a tree stump ...). Garvey shouldn \\' t be in the HOF . SkyJack ? I \\' ve said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so , but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris \\' \" ability to win \" which is nothing more than Morris \\' \" ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs \". At this point , Morris is an average pitcher ( although from his early returns in \\' 93 , he may be damned close to done .). But , in all fairness , Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80 \\' s for up - and - down Tiger teams . While 1984 was ( obviously ) a great year for Detroit , the rest of the decade , the team was generally in contention , but not favorites . Morris \\' career numbers are quite good , and worthy of HOF \" consideration \". Ryan ? Of course , but be careful . I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about \" Yount and Smith being shortstops who hung around a long time \". After all , Nolan never won a Cy ... Damn , he \\' s just pitcher who hung around for 99 years ... His W - L record is mediocre ... ( Of course , Nolan \\' s a HOF \\' er ...) Puck ? Probably , although he \\' s got to play reasonably well for a few more years ( 10 years , even good ones , aren \\' t enough to make the HOF , most likely ). That said , I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF , pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out ( barring something REALLY tragic or sudden ). He \\' s very popular in the media and with fans , and legitimately has been one of the best CF \\' s in the game since he joined the league . I \\' ve always liked the guy , and I hope he does make it . And , in the end , I think the Puck will make it in . But , really , it \\' s too early to sell . This debate comes up rather frequently on the net , and , believe it or not , I never tire of it . It \\' s an interesting subject . Here \\' s an off the top of my head list of potential HOF \\' ers from each team . I probably left a couple of guys off , so feel free to follow up . I won \\' t consider ANYONE who started playing after about 1985 ( again , too early to tell .) [ Note : these are all active players , I \\' m not counting recent retirees ] Baltimore : Cal Ripken ( should be a lock by now , even if Gehrig \\' s record stands ) Boston : Roger Clemens ( might be a lock already , which is amazing ), Dawson (?) Detroit : Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker ( possibilities ) Milwaukee : Robin Yount ( discussed earlier ) New York : Wade Boggs ( possibly ), Mattingly ( long shot ) Toronto : Paul Molitor and Jack Morris ( possibilities ) Kansas City : George Brett ( lock ) Minnesota : Kirby ( too early to tell ), Winfield ( lock ) Oakland : Eckersley ( lock ), McGwire ( too early ), Rickey ( lock ), Welch ( LONG shot ) Texas : The Mighty Nolan [ Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)] Cubs : Sandberg ( lock ) St .

San Diego : Tony Gwynn ( pretty good shot ) Colorado : Dale Murphy ( a good shot ), Ryan Bowen ( just to see if you \\' re awake ) [ Before I get flames : this is an off - the - top - of - the - head list , there \\' s probably a few deserving candidates that I left off , and , I didn \\' t include Barry Bonds , Will Clark , Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher , Frank Thomas , Canseco , McGriff , etc . because I only considered guys who started playing before 1985 )] E - mail or post , I almost fear what I may have started here ...',\n",

       " \"The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their quest for more left - handed pitching . So far , no takers . Personally , I think Harris is a defensive liability , and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays , or at least been among the leaders . Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day , he can get the job done . If Sharpy played just one base every day , say third , he ' d also improve defensively . Wallach has helped tremendously on defense , as has Reed . The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff . Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays . Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years . Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances . The Dodgers are turning double plays , and keeping more balls in the infield than last year . And Piazza has also been great on defense . He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first . Wallach , clearly , has contributed to the over all improvement on defense . But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs . But I don ' t think he is as bad as his current average . I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw seem to have come out of theirs .\",\n",

       " 'Punch Imlach \\' s contributions as a coach and GM were far greater than those of the above combined . Should we name a division or trophy after him ? Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they were powerful owners . As owners they certainly did help to build the league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether . Are we going to honour those who contributed to the league \\' s evolution or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the sport itself ? I can \\' t disagree with you here . What have you heard ? The Major was the * definitive * little asshole ! He originated the phrase \" if you can \\' t beat \\' em in the alley you can \\' t beat \\' em on the ice .\" That was his idea of hockey . Do you think , by chance , that Don Cherry is a classy individual ? The money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on , and that is : \" it is the players that are what make the game great and not the people who put them on the ice \" Exactly true . Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch is the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame . I have always thought that this was nonsense . --',\n",

The bottom four teams last year were essentially tied . Boston , in seventh place , had 73 wins . The Yankees and Indians , tied for fourth place , had 76 wins . Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than the Indians or Tigers . Basically , the Red Sox are stronger this year at 1B , DH , SS , LF , and RF . They have healthier starting pitchers ( so far , at least ) and better relievers . I see no reason why they shouldn ' t win ~ 85 games .

       " \"But , Gary , for certain sofa tubers like myself , this is an advantage . I can watch the Pirates on KBL , the Mets on WWOR , the Braves on TBS , and the mediots on ESPN at the same time , without missing anything . ( If something impressive happens , I ' ll catch the replay :-) ). So , I see ( essentially ) 4 games in 3 hours , instead of 1 game in 2 hours . What a deal ! ( Insert smileys as desired ...)\",\n",
       " \": : Of course , penalties will have to be changed : : : Roughing : Chauvanistic Males Being Aggressive : Slashing : Chauvanistic Males Venting Frustration : Fighting : Proof That Males Cannot Cope With Their Feelings : NO NO NO ! since all the penalties fall into three classes , there should only be three penalties : 1 . Foul ( Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your body or stick ). If you get 5 you are out for the game . 2 . Unsportsmanlike contact . ( An intentional foul ). This inlcludes all the current flavours of roughing , fighting and boarding . If you get two you are thrown out of the game , and fined . 3 . Technical foul . Bad mouthing the ref , by player or coach . Penalty shot is awarded . Two and you are thrown out of the game . Besides the penalty shot for one technical , if the team gets 5 penalties in a period , the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one , until the end of the period . The victim gets two shots if he / she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured . This works well for several reasons . First , penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey , right ? So , it follows that the more the better . Next , when the player is setting up for a penalty shot , the network can take a commercial . Finally , with only three penalties , the network announcers ( Don Meredith , Dick Vitale , John Madden , Pat Summerall , and Marv Levy , among others ) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the PA announcer says it . Oh , one other rule . When a goal is scored ( 10 - 20 times a period ), the play cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it . This way , the network can sneak in a few more commercials . Then , once the PA announcer has told them who scored , the TV announcer can tell you the viewer , and even have a chance of pronouncing his name right . Seriously , though , I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week , for the first time in my life . I was amazed how boring it was . The play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free - throw shooting contests DURING THE PERIOD !. Of course the ' Laker Girls ' get to do their routines at least 6 - 8 times during the game , and not just between periods either . There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average , maybe less . The game is 48 minutes , with 2 minutes between quarters 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 and a 10 minute halftime , and it still takes over 2 hours . The reason for this has to be TV . There is plenty of room to throw in commercials , and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening . On TV , basketball is fairly entertaining , IMHO . But , it is better to watch it on TV than to be there . If this is the road the NHL is following , then it truly is a sad day . Enough for now .\",\n",

       " \"During the first three games of the Pens - Devils series , I have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens . Jagr , MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch . But , one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman . Despite Brooks ' lunatic comments , and despite the Devils ' line changing adantage in last night ' s game , Bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the Devils in the dark . Granted , the hell - dwellers had the Pens bottled up for a while last night , but Bowman was eventually able to configure his line - up to get the job done . His ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible . Bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis . Last night , for instance , he realized that the speed of Jagr , Straka , and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance . As a result , Straka received many more shifts than average ; Jagr played almost the entire game ( he was always on the puck ), and MacEachern scored a goal , while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night . His ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is commendable , especially when a coach of such a talented team might simply rely on the overall talent to dominate , and to bring about success .\",\n",

On the other hand BASEBALL is the * gasp ** swoon ** sigh * \" NATIONAL PASTTIME \". BASEBALL is so romanticized in the US that you are supposed to forget that other sport exist after April 1 and before November 1 . I feel that since ESPN shows 5 + BASEBALL games a week they should be able to show an OT hockey game instead of the opening innings of a BASEBALL game . Hell , the game is going to last 2hrs 45mins , so what if you miss the first 1 1 / 2 hrs ? And I am an Indians fan ! Show the end of what you started , then switch !

       " '[ stuff deleted ...] As I recall , the author of the _original_ article that started the thread claimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons . Roger , on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a \" jingoistic rant \", but you also supported the name - changing on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent . FWIW , I do not think the flaming was warranted , nor do I think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all . Just an observation ... However , that aside , the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it ( making it easier for the \\' casual fan \\'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour . IMO , the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports . In addition , I do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey , so it \\' s a pointless exercise anyway . If the current names are inappropriate , then that is a separate issue , not central to the original article . Something to consider additionally is whether or not players like Orr who \\' contributed to the glory of the sport \\' would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to play in . In this case , honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken - and - egg type question . ( although it was the chicken .....)

Speaking of Chelios , I wonder if Serge Savard feels like a moron for making that trade . I also wish we still had Corson . Rob Ramage on the ice is less useful than a Gatorade bottle on the bench . Vincent Damphousse has decided to take a vacation , apparently . I have no idea why Demers is playing Denis Savard on the checking line with Carbonneau . Savard is skating well , and is one of the only dangerous Canadiens in Quebec \\' s zone with the puck . Too bad nobody is in front most of the time . Do you also notice that in the defensive zone , not a single Nordique gets knocked down ? It \\' s disgusting . We also have Lebeau ( 5 \\' 10 \", 172 ) getting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn ( 6 \\' 3 \", 205 ) with no reply from the team , except to yell for a penalty . Dammit , Denis Savard threw the best ( only ?) Montreal hit of the night when he knocked Sundin off - balance . When Denis Savard is your team \\' s enforcer , there \\' s big trouble someplace ... Aside from that second goal , Roy did stand on his head . The third period at least provided something to look forward to . Habs won the period , IMO , and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game had started at 7 : 30 . Hopefully they play that way at home . Roy made the saves ( we \\' ll ignore that second goal ), so now it \\' s up to the team . -- dchhabra @ stpl . ists . ca',\n",

       " \"Did anyone happen to see Peter Gammons on ESPN last night ? He addressed this exact issue , and dismissed it rather quickly . According to Gammons , advanced scouts are reporting that Morris ' fastball and slider still have the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability to keep the ball hidden during his release . Guzman and Stottlemyre have gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a little work with the pitching coach . Gammons looks to see Morris back in top form within the month . I , on the other hand , still have my doubts . Morris ' ERA last year was rather high for a pitcher who won 20 games . His showing in the Series was not surprising . Although I ' m not convinced that he ' s washed up , I have my doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the Twins in ' 91 .\",\n",

And that ' s the mental problem ( the one they ' ve had for a number of years ) I tried to point out .

No , he wasn \\' t always spot on top of the play , and he wasn \\' t overly cute , but those pipes ! That lusty , barrel chested , voice ! No pipsqueak was he ( unlike some fellas we know !) I rode into hockey mania on the coattails of Gretzky and the Boys on the Bus . My first Finals saw the Islanders sweep them . But I \\' ll never forget the night , a year later , when the Oilers closed it out at home in the pandemonium , the smoke from a million sparklers , the long empty - net goal near the end , and Dan Kelly letting the crowd \\' s reaction tell the story for a few long seconds , then that voice barking through the din \" Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton !\" It sounds stupid , but that early ( for me ) hockey memory will always bring a thrill .

       " \"Hmmm ... what about walks and SB ? Baerga got clobbered by Alomar in OBP and beat him in SLG by a lesser margin . Even putting aside any other factors , a player with a 51 point edge in OBP is more productive than a player with a 28 point edge in SLG . The issue has been studied before , and I doubt you could come up with any convincing argument the other way . People see the batting average and the HR , but they don ' t really know their value is worth unless they ' ve studied the issue closely . The fact is that Baerga ate up a LOT more outs than Alomar ; while Baerga was making outs , Alomar was drawing walks and being on base for Carter , Winfield et . al .\",\n",

As far as the arena in general being boring , well Richard ' s got that right . It ' s been that way all season . I attribute it to a lot of new fans who just don ' t have the same spirit and knowledge as long - time fans . At last Tuesday ' s game , I overheard a man express surprise that a goaltender can get an assist . Anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen at any time . I ' m confident in the Pens but I ' m also not stupid enough to think for one minute that it ' s impossible for New Jersey to blow them out of this series . I doubt that will happen but it ' s possible . Bored ? Uh - uh . Spoiled ? Not in the least . Forgot what excitement is like ? Living through that amazing streak wasn ' t exciting ?!

If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time ( X = 3 to 5 ) without successfully picking off the runner , the runner advances a base as if walked . This last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases considerably . Suppose the pitcher uses up ( N - 1 ) of his N pick - off attempts .

       " \"The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory , a 5 - 4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers . The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich , just his 5th of the season and his first game winner . The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game . For the Whalers , the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season . Roster move : Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill Injuries : Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4 / 15 and was scratched . Lines : Eklund - Lindros - Recchi Beranek - Brind ' Amour - Dineen Lomakin - Butsayev - Conroy Faust - Acton - Brown Galley - Bowen Yushkevich - Hawgood Carkner - Hynes Dominic Roussel Game Summary : I didn ' t get TV coverage of the game , and since it was stormy in these parts I didn ' t have the best radio coverage either . Here ' s the box score followed by a few things I did pick up : First Period : Hartford , Nylander 10 , 8 : 51 Philadelphia , Recchi 53 ( Lindros , Brind ' Amour ), 19 : 59 . 8 ( pp ) Penalties - Verbeek , Har ( holding ), : 55 ; Carkner , Phi ( roughing ), 13 : 53 ; Houda , Har ( interference ) 18 : 43 Second Period : Hartford , Burt 6 ( Cunneyworth , Kron ), 2 : 00 Philadelphia , Bowen 1 ( Eklund , Recchi ), 7 : 09 Hartford , Nylander 11 ( Zalapski , Sanderson ), 9 : 38 Penalties - Galley , Phi , major - game misconduct ( spearing ) : 58 ; Verbeek , Har major - game misconduct ( spearing ), : 58 ; Brown , Phi ( tripping ), 3 : 22 ; Zalapski , Har ( tripping ), 15 : 51 ; Brind ' Amour , Phi ( slashing ), 19 : 50 Third Period : Hartford , Kron 14 ( Sanderson , Cassels ), 1 : 24 ( pp ) Philadelphia , Beranek 15 ( Lomakin , Yushkevich ), 3 : 11 Philadelphia , Faust 2 ( Brind ' Amour , Roussel ), 3 : 38 Penalties - Houda , Har ( tripping ), 4 : 20 ; Hawgood , Phi ( holding ), 5 : 30 Overtime : Philadelphia , Yushkevich 5 ( Faust ), 1 : 15 . Penalties - None Power Play : Philadelphia 1 of 4 , Hartford 1 of 4 Goalies : Philadelphia , Roussel 14 - 11 - 5 ( 30 shots - 26 saves ) Hartford , Lenarduzzi , 1 - 1 - 1 ( 38 - 33 ) On the first Hartford goal , Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off . The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros . The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net , got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie . On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in . This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense . Take the body , and if they get one shot and beat you fine . Don ' t give them another chance . Carkner , Galley and McGill are all terrible about this , I ' ll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play . That ' s all I have , my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored , much less how . From what I heard , Roussel had a very strong game . After the game , Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game . It was Garry Galley # 3 for his career high point total ( I ' m surprised that a former goalie wouldn ' t look closer at his defensive play ), Tommy Soderstrom # 2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1 / 2 a season and , Mark Recchi # 1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark . But here ' s the odd part . He couldn ' t decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1 . If he picks Recchi as # 1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros , doesn ' t that make Lindros # 2 ???? What ? You wanna know my three stars of the season ? Well , since you asked ... # 1 Eric Lindros . Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice . The difference between the team ' s record with him and without him is no accident . I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi . There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it , and I think that he will deservedly wear the ' C ' on his jersey next season . # 2 Tommy Soderstrom . 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour , and Tommy didn ' t have a Chris Chelios ( booo ) in front of him . He also didn ' t play a complete season due to heart problems ( sentimental edge here , my family has a history of heart problems ). There ' s no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future , and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years . # 3 Mark Recchi . Again , you can ' t argue with an all - time team high single season scoring mark . There are an awful lot of teams that didn ' t have a single player get as many points . Plus , Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season . Not a tough choice . Honorable mentions : Rod Brind ' Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year . The difference was that he wasn ' t on the top line this year and didn ' t get as much playing time . Then again , he didn ' t get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either . Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman . Yes , he made rookie mistakes , but he was usually fast enough to make up for them . I have a feeling that with his shot he ' ll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone , and I suspect that he ' ll be the teams top defenseman in years to come . Garry Galley was the team ' s point leader from defensemen . Again , there are some things you just can ' t argue with . And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome , he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game , and that was against his wishes under doctors orders . But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution . A little more caution , and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year . Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total . But consistency became a problem for him .

If you ' re interested , you can send him mail at : att ! ACR . ORG ! TMISNIK The FLYERS end the season 1 game below . 500 in 5th place , their best winning percentage since going . 500 in 1988 - 89 . 14 - 20 - 3 within the division ( 4th in Patrick ), 23 - 14 - 5 at home . They finished 17th overall , will draft 10th in next years entry draft ( Quebec had the 1st rounder , though ). They scored as many goals as they allowed , 319 . The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985 . I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them , since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them . I hope you ' ve all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have . Knowing the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time almost bearable .

       " 'I can understand your anger about the German audience . I mean , it was the Finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous penalties the Canadien ref called in the last period . The Germans got a match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and seconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for \" delay of game \" for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd . The resulting 5 : 3 skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point , when the Germans were starting to come up strong . I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events . If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not able to play for minutes , because the crowd is so obnoxious . But I have to admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most other countries ( you should go to the US and watch the way they present the Olympics on television ; or the soccer crowds in England ; or the Finnish spectators at nordic skiing events .....). I mean it makes me sick to see all this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best team / player win and get cheared at . I do not mind if my favorite team looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to admit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team to watch ( the German soccer team is boring to watch , for example ). But , reading the above posting , I think that you are on the same level as these crowds you are criticizing . It is easy to talk of ( nearly all ) Germans as Nazis and nationalists ; thats the kind of propaganda that all ultraconservative people use against Germany . It is true that there is a great danger of re - arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience most of the people ( at least of the people that i know ) also regard this as a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now . Why can \\' t we just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers corresponding to their nationality ( eg . all Russians are Communists ; all Americans are Capitalists ; all Germans are Nazis , all Fins are hanging around beeing drunk on ferries ...).

       " 'My votes ( FWIW ): Team MVP : Pat Verbeek . He fans on 25 % of goal mouth feeds , but he still has 36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary ( sp ?) team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons . Honorable mention : Nick Kypreos and Mark Janssens . Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP , but Kypreos ( 17 goals , 320 + PIM ) has been the hardest working player on the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker . I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value . Biggest surprise : Geoff Sanderson . He had 13 goals and 31 points last season as a center , then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80 + points . He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals , most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle , his garden spot . Honorable mention : Andrew Cassels and Terry Yake . The kiddie quartet of Sanderson , Poulin , Nylander , and Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention , but Cassels is just 23 and will score close to 90 points this season . He has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson . Yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put up about 20 goals and 50 points this season . Yake , like Sanderson , started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing , although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the right side . Biggest disappointment : Hands down , John Cullen . Cullen had a disasterous 77 point season last year , his first full season after The Trade . Cullen started the season off of summer back surgery , and fell flat on his face ( appropriate , since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass , and whining about it ). Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games , was a clubhouse malcontent , commanded the powerplay to a 9 % success percentage (> 21 % with Sanderson ), and sulked his way out of town . Worst of all , his 4 year , $ 4M contract had three years left to run , so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the Maple Leafs offered to Hartford . Honorable mention : Steve Konroyd , also subpar after signing a 3 year , $ 2 . 1M contract ; Eric Weinrich , who showed flashes of competence , but overall has played poorly ; Jim McKenzie , who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now ; and Frank Pietrangelo , who only seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row .',\n",
       " \"Let ' s start over . I ' m not arguing about who is the better goaltender . I ' d take Soderstrom right now . What I am saying is that Roussel can be a # 1 netminder . The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game ( less than that after last night ), their save percentages are close , and their records are similar . And with that , I just don ' t see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season . You say Soderstrom played against better competition . That may very well be , but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in those games . Besides , against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh , the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose . But I ' m not just judging Roussel on that game alone . I ' ve seen him play for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey . It ' s just my opinion , but I think he ' s got what it takes . Of course , I thought that about Mark LaForest , too . But I never did about Wendell Young . So I ' m batting . 500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall - era . As for the Rangers game , you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like . But Rou had his leg in position to make the save . If he didn ' t , it wouldn ' t have mattered if the Rangers player didn ' t get the puck up or not . It would have been a goal . On a breakaway that ' s what the goalie wants to do , take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him . I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two - time defending champs . And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the Habs . But you can ' t tell me that a Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it . Mistakes , both on offense and defense are part of the game . Or there ' d never be shutouts . Anyway , I ' m happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and I ' m not going to argue about it anymore . Besides , with the current 7 - game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year , I don ' t want to piss you off to the point that you don ' t sell me any tickets next season :-).\",\n",

Prince has never hit well in the minors and he ' s now 27 years old , I think . Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors . ( I ' ll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don ' t have another brain cramp and forget .) He had a very good year at Louisville before coming up to the majors . As I recall , the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit , decent fielding . When he got to the majors and didn ' t hit as well as expected ( not as much playing time ?), he became Exhibit 312 in Nichols ' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation as an outstanding defensive catcher . It ' s not clear he ever learned to hit .

If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince , given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors , it ' s not a rosy picture . BTW , I ' m still unhappy with moving Zeile , who had the same reputation coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi , except that he was a much , much better hitter , to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well - above average hitter as an average ( or below average ) fielding catcher .

Sorry about that . # 8 LARRY DEPALMA Season : 3rd Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , free agent from Minnesota Grade : I ( C -/ D +) No netter / fan watching the Sharks , including me , knows where DePalma was at the end of the season ; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights , but he wasn \\' t in San Jose , he wasn \\' t in Kansas City , and his name hasn \\' t appeared on the waiver wire . And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for DePalma . After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning , DePalma had an excellent week , scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense . Unfortunately , the 27 - year - old DePalma then disappeared the rest of the way , getting just 3 more points in 15 more games , and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice . He then was sent down to Kansas City , walked out from there , and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured ; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of Shark Bytes ( as the mailing list is now known to Sharks officials ) faithful , and neither the Sharks nor we miss him . # 10 JOHAN GARPENLOV Season : 3rd Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round pick in \\' 92 entry draft from Vancouver Grade : A / A - After an early slump , Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way , finishing with 66 points in 79 games , second highest total on the team , as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob Gaudreau . Kisio got most of the credit , but Garpenlov , finishing second in the MVP voting , clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills , as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders , getting a club - high 14 power - play goals . Contrary to his previous rep , Garpenlov also showed that despite his small size ( 5 \\' 11 \", 183 lbs .), he was willing to throw himself around when necessary , albeit not very successful yet . He also still needs to work on his defense , although he improved tremendously throughout the season , and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season . He will be a major key to the offense next year . # 15 DAVID BRUCE Season : 5th Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , from St . Louis in expansion draft Grade : I (?) After a banner \\' 91 - 92 , when he led the team in power - play goals ( 10 ) and was third in total scoring ( 38 points in 60 games ), Bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury , which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season . Of course , it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury , but the 28 - year - old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the Sharks \\' first season , and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well . The injury appears serious , which is a shame , because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now ; instead , his future with the Sharks next season appears clouded . # 18 MARK PEDERSON Season : 3rd Acquired : \\' 92 - 93 , trade with Philadelphia for C / LW Dave Snuggerud Grade : I ( B ) It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers \\' decision to unload Pederson , after a very good offensive season last season ( 40 points in 58 games ), but after riding the pine early in the season , Pederson was summarily sent to the Sharks in exchange of the defensive - minded Snuggerud , and he finished with 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks . He was also limited by injuries this season , and this limited his production ( 17 points ). But when healthy , Pederson appears impressive , with a good scoring touch , good size ( and the willingness to throw it around , although he \\' s not considered a physical forward ), and good speed . He also does not appear to be a liability on defense , but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much , exactly , Pederson can do . # 20 JOHN CARTER Season : 4th Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , free agent from Boston Grade : I ( B +/ B ) Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team , and the hard work worked wonders , as at times he looked great on ice . However , although he did look great at times , the fact that he received just 16 points ( in 55 games ) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do , and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about 20 games left in the season . Carter , who will turn 30 on May 6 , always hussled , but as a result , was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking , but he was generally a credit on the defensive end , but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity , and he did not impress offensively , although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties . He is very unlikely to be back next season . # 28 JEAN - FRANCOIS QUINTIN Season : 1st Acquired : \\' 91 - 92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : I ( B +/ B ) I don \\' t understand why the Sharks didn \\' t let Quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season . He was generally hard - working and creating opportunities offensively , and appeared , at age 23 , ready for regular NHL duty , at least for a team like the Sharks , finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability . Shoulder injury in training camp before the \\' 91 - 92 season limited Quintin , the team \\' s leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two , to just 29 games with the Sharks and the Blades that season , but he looked impressive . He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season . # 41 MARK BEAUFAIT Season : 1st Acquired : 2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft Grade : I (?) After a all - star season at Kansas City , Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the Sharks decimated with injuries , playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only NHL point thus far . Despite small size ( 5 \\' 9 \", 165 lbs .), Beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary , and looked pretty good at times , although it \\' s too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games , in which he played mostly left wing , away from his center position at Northern Michigan and Kansas City . # 42 JAROSLAV OTEVREL Season : 1st Acquired : 8th round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade : I (?) Like Beaufait , Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea ( 7 games ) midway through the season . He was generally very much of a defensive liability , and did not show much offensively either , although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games . He may need another season to work on his defense , but once his defense is acceptable , he should be ready . # 44 MICHEL PICARD Season : 1st Acquired : \\' 92 - 93 , trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau Grade : I ( B -/ C +) The 23 - year - old Picard , although he perennially tore up the minors , seems to be close to being out of chances , for some reason , after being acquired by the Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games , scoring 4 goals for his only points , and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City . He was not particularly strong defensively , and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors , he has failed thus far to score in the NHL , although he has been given limited opportunities . He may be the Sharks \\' bait in the expansion draft . # 45 DODY WOOD Season : 1st Acquired : 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade : I ( D +/ D , although perhaps I shouldn \\' t give a grade at all ) I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much . :-) Then , it is probably no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far , although 13 games is a small example . He was generally a nonfactor on offense , was not particularly good defensively , and took too many silly penalties , losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games , projecting to to 446 (!) in an 84 - game season . He \\' s not ready , and needs at least another season at KC , where he can work on his fighting skills , if nothing else . His relatively small size ( 5 \\' 11 \", 181 lbs .) does not give much possibility that he can survive , at this stage , as an enforcer .',\n",
       " 'Actually , fired - coach George Kingston was a third of the GM triumvirate .

       " 'Philadelphia at Chicago : Teams tied for 1st after Sunday Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series . One Friday , one Saturday , and a good - old Sunday doubleheader . \" What could be better ,\" declared Ernie Banks . Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging ? \" It \\' s pitching , it \\' s always been pitching that we \\' ve lacked ,\" announced Ryne Sandberg . \" If we can get by Brewer , then beat Carlton , Alexander , or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we \\' ll know we might be able to win . \" Lord , I hope we pull it off .\" The Phils scored once in the top of the first ; Richie Ashburn singled , Pete Rose followed with a hit , sending Ashburn around second . Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center , and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks , who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third . Rose went to second on the play . Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center , moving Pete Rose to third . Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them . Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130 - 150 walks this year . Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well , and he lashed a double into a gap in right - center . \" Cool Papa \" Bell \\' s speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring . Nellie Fox was walked , and Bob Boone grounded out to second , ending the threat . \" Teams are starting to realize that you don \\' t have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti , and that is lowering their run total . It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen ( who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first ), and it \\' s a credit to the Phillies that they \\' ve been able to sustain their pace . The picthers have slumped at times .\" So came the analysis from Frank Chance . The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit , Thomas \\' grounder moved him to second , and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run . In the sixth , Ron Santo launched a two - run homer to make it 3 - 1 . Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth , as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third . Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox , but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit . Allen doubled to right , but luckily for the Cubs , Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense . He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third . Lance Parrish , hitting for Boone , was walked , and Bruce Sutter entered . Larry Bowa grounded into a 1 - 2 - 3 double play , but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch - hitter . Desiring a strikeout , since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch - running at third , Chance brought in Lee Smith , who induced a pop - up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder , ending the inning . The Cubs took the win , 3 - 2 , moving a game behind the Phillies . Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3 - Finger Brown Saturday . To get another righthander in the lineup , Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third . Unfortunately , Brown allowed six doubles , and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more , as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty . Madlock , batting sixth , had knocked two doubles of his own , driving home four runs . Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs , and Cuyler added another , and the score was 8 - 6 , Cubs after six innings . The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth , as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11 - 7 triumph . Sunday \\' s twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point , including a rare outside - the - park home run in the second game , off Robin Roberts . Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest , 4 - 2 , but the Cubs captured the second one 5 - 4 , with Waddell gaining the win . Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save , though he allowed one run in the eighth . The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co - leaders , and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday . ------------------------------------------------------------------- Montreal at St . Louis ( August 3 - 6 ): 3 - way tie for 1st Dennis Martinez is on a roll , and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday . The Expos have a wide variety of hitters , and - while they aren \\' t among the all - time greats , they are getting the job done . After winning their first first two games , they suddenly found themselves only 2 1 / 2 games out of first in this wacky season . Martinez triumphed 5 - 3 on Friday , and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3 - 2 Saturday . However , the Cardinals refused to give up , winning 6 - 2 on Sunday . The Cards captured Monday \\' s game , too , as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3 - 2 . \" We \\' re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed ,\" remarked Lou Brock . \" I don \\' t see why we can \\' t win this division .\" The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them . Two - thirds of the way through the season , there is a 3 - way tie for first . ------------------------------------------------------------------- New York at Pittsburgh ( August 3 - 6 ): 3 straight 3 - 2 wins for Bucs , now 2 back - but in 4th ! \" When your team is in a slump like we are , the worst thing is to play in a pitcher \\' s park like this ,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series . Keith Hernandez added that \" their defense takes away quite a few runs per year , and it must be giving them an extra 6 - 7 wins .\" The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season , 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers . Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All - Time teams . Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5 - 2 Friday , and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3 - 2 Saturday , in a game featuring some outstanding defense . When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6 - hit the Mets in another 3 - 2 win Sunday , the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the . 500 mark . They had been unable to several times in the past month . Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game . Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff , and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two - run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates . The Mets \\' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco , working his second inning , after Mookie Wilson pinch - ran for Gary Carter at second . With one out and a runner on first , Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch - hit . The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve , placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter . Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second . He slid hard into Honus Wagner , preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon . Tekulve allowed a hit , but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line , ending the inning . Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers , who entered to pitch the eighth , and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center , running through the stop sign at third to score an inside - the - park homer to win . The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3 - 2 wins , and had moved to within 2 games of first place , with seven weeks to go . ------------------------------------------------------------------ San Francisco at Boswaukta ( August 3 - 5 ): Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule , as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn \\' t tire . In fact , reported manager John McGraw , \" once this rough part of the schedule is over , maybe as early as this coming week , we may shift to a 4 - man rotation again for a little while .\" Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday , beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4 - 1 . Willie Mays had all four r . b . i . s on 3 hits . Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest . The Braves \\' park had been a homer haven , but this took the cake , as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16 - 13 . Willie Mays had three homers , Willie McCovey , Eddie Matthews , and Don Baylor had two , and Hank Aaron , Ernie Lombardi , Biz Mackey , and Mel Ott had one each . The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday \\' s doubleheader , putting them on a pace for 223 , which would be 4 short of the National League record . They were still a tad behind the \\' 61 Yankees \\' pace . They had allowed over 120 , though . Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth . He allowed only a run in the sixth , but faltered in the seventh . Joe McGinnity earned the save . In the doubleheader , the Braves \\' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game , but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won , 4 - 3 . The Giants took the second game , however , by a 6 - 2 score . The homer by Aaron was a magical # 150 by the Braves ; however , they fell to three game below . 500 , making a comeback extremely unlikely . ------------------------------------------------------------------- San Diego at Cincinnati ( Aug . 3 - 5 ): Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3 - game series , and the Padres felt rather good . With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game , the trade looked even better . McGriff \\' s batting average was even rising . Of course , the bench was very poor , and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield , but these were minor problems , since the pitching was holding up . Jones pitched a good game Friday , and won 6 - 3 . McGriff launched two home runs . Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday ; 5 - 4 was the final score . Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3 - 3 tie through eight innings before departing . The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth . Paige had departed after 10 , and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning . Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning , when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around . Thurm Munson doubled both runners home , and the Padres gamed a 5 - 3 win . The three - game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds . Though the Reds denied it , the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them . ------------------------------------------------------------------- Brookangeles at Houston ( August 3 - 5 ): Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome . The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game , opposite Don Drysdale . \" Normally ,\" Drysdale remarked , \" I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them . I can \\' t afford to with this team , though ; we have to get our own runners going ; we can \\' t Davis will get decked once .\" The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked , but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season . The hitting on this team is a little better , but the power is all doubles and triples . Still , Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend , as he threw two runners out trying for inside - the - park homers . For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros \\' park , they have a 23 - foot high gray wall all around the outfield ; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs . The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate , but the alleys are 400 feet away , with center field at 420 feet . \" It \\' s as if some three - year - old threw a tantrum and told his playmates : \\' If I can \\' t hit home runs , nobody will hit home runs \\',\" remarked Roy Campanella . The Dodgers stole five bases Friday , but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before ; for tonight , anyway , Davis , Jim Wynn , and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings , according to the manager . After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop , Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch . He responded with a two - run double , but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up , and the Astros didn \\' t score any more in that inning . They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3 - 2 deficit , and the Astros wound up winning 6 - 4 . They threatened to do even better the next game , as Tommy John would be their opponent . Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A . M . before the game . \" I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop ,\" he explained . \" How can we do that ,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered . \" They \\' re going to be beating the ball down , so we \\' ve got to be ready to throw on the run . Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt , but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws . We \\' ll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time .\" The plan almost worked . Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings , but the Astros got three ; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third . 3 - 2 Astros was the final , with Dave Smith earning another save . The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday , as Nolan Ryan walked five , three of whom scored in a 4 - 1 Dodger win . Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4 - 2 to Don Sutton , however , as the Dodgers \\' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough . \" We \\' re mostly a power team ,\" remarked Ron Cey . \" Jackie and , when he plays , Maury Wills are our only real speed demons , though a couple other plays can do it now and then . We \\' re sunk in a place like the Astrodome . I guess that \\' s why they \\' re so successful there .\" Indeed , it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome . The \\' Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts , giving them 230 on the season . Standings after these weekend series : A . L .

To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism from those who only follow ' the hot team '. This statement is supported based on the increased number of ' Brave Woofers ' out on the net . A true fan of a team , any team , will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years , and be amply rewarded when the time is right . Yeah , so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in ` 86 . Who cares if Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower . The fact is , they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them . Now that it appears that they are on lean times , the number of detracters come from all over .

Fielding Runs thus gives a first baseman no credit for putouts or double plays , only for assists and errors . It thus favors first basemen who play deep , reaching a lot of balls but forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently . It also hurts first baseman who play behind left - handed pitching staffs and thus face few left - handed batters . This is better ; of course , it still isn ' t all of a first baseman ' s defense .

       " 'Well , actually , most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it happened . But that \\' s OK , I understand you have a hockey background . Stats like \" plus / minus \" make RBI look good . OK , how about a straigh answer , then . Here \\' s a very simele question to which I \\' m sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to . Please answer yes or no , Roger : Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs ? AL only , please . For anyone else following along , it is a well - known and demonstrable fact that a team \\' s win - loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows . It \\' s not a definite , hard - and - fast function , but there is definitely a correlation . In fact , as a rule of thumb , if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs , for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows , it will win another game . So , for instance , if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays , we find that they scored 780 runs and allowed 682 , of which Morris allowed 114 . All other things being equal , if Frank Viola , with his 3 . 44 ERA had replaced Jack Morris for the 240 . 2 innings Morris threw ( plausible , since Viola threw 238 for Boston ), the \" Red Jays \" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs , or enough for 1 - 2 more wins . Now , that doesn \\' t take into account that Viola pitched half his innings in Fenway , which is a harder park to pitch in ( particularly for a lefthander ) than Skydome . So , um , Roger . Unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores , could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis ? Clearly , it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would necessarily have put up a 3 . 44 if he had been on the Jay last year , but that is not the claim . We look at what the actual performances were and evaluate Viola \\' s as better than Morris \\' in the sense that \" had Morris performed as Viola did , his team would have been better off .\" This is true , but not so open that your brain falls out .

He needs to , as the papers say , \" get that monkey off his back .\" So it becomes a matter not of intelligence , but of pride . Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic ?

       " 'Until six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL football . Last year I hardly watched a game . What turned me off were the incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game . A team scores . 2 . 5 minutes of commercials . Kickoff . 1 . 5 minutes of commercials . Three downs and a punt . 2 minutes of commercials . AAAAARRRRGH ! Earlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A \\' s , whom I believe institutionalize slow play . I don \\' t mind the cat - and - mouse game with Rickey on first ; in fact , I rather enjoy it . Similarly I would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first . What I object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first , or when the game is a blowout . I don \\' t mind when the pitcher steps off the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation , or when a hitter steps out of the box to regain his concentration . What I object to is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity . When a game is exciting , these little delays serve as tension builders and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game . When the delays happen with regularity , they become nuisances , just like the commercial breaks in football . I understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to \" speed up \" the games , basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move the markers and the ball to the spots faster . That did not address the problem of the continuity of the game . It may have appeased the sponsors and the networks , but I would be amazed if it did anything to enhance the experience of the fans . Similary , while some 3 - hour baseball games bore me to tears , those are the ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly long periods to get ready for each pitch . I doubt if anyone watching the Braves - Giants game cared about Gant stepping out . I doubt if anyone watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that was present . I would be totally opposed to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of baseball . On the other hand , I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful enough to sit down with Alderson / LaRussa / Duncan and explain that they are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games out the way that they do .

       " \"^^^^^^^ ^^^^ Please pardon my ignorance if this is well known , but what is the current rule ? Maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make , and award a balk if he exceeds it . I ' d have another question : who would operate the pitch clock ? One of the umpires ? Add another one to the crew ? I ' m not sure I like this idea . I think it would severely diminish the number of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic ploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play ( one of my personal favorites ). Ahhh ! I suppose I should read the whole article before I hit the ' f ' key , eh ? Obviously , from what I wrote above , I like this idea . It may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag , since the pitcher knows he doesn ' t have very many chances to pick off the runner , so he may hurry too much . I ' d rather see runs scored as the result of sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness that could result from this kind of rule . So , I suppose there are some disadvantages to that idea too . I remember in little league , if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter ' s box , even for a moment , we were automatically out . That may be a little harsh for the majors , but seriously , how about putting a limit on the batters being able to step out , take several dozen practice swings , pound their shoes , scratch their balls , etc .? Maybe forcing them to stay in the batter ' s box wouldn ' t be such a bad idea . That could save a few minutes .\",\n",

       " 'First , a longer game in no way suggests \" more baseball to watch ,\" unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball .

And the final standings were : W L GB St . Louis 93 69 - Philadelphia 92 70 1 Cincinnati 92 70 1 San Francisco 90 72 3 Now it doesn ' t appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short were really overused , at least by the four - man rotation standard of the day , until well along into the 10 - game losing streak , at which time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the Phillies substantial lead had evaporated . The way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse , although Bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10 - 0 shutout of the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant . Bunning pitched a complete game six - hitter , striking out five and walking one . It would be inetersting to see , though , how the total innings for the year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league . Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1 through October 1 ; while they didn ' t play substantially more games than the other teams , the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch .\",\n",

       " \"The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to death , but I haven ' t seen anything in rsb yet . Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run . He stroked a line drive into the right field corner . The ball cleared the three - foot high fence and went into the crowd . Darryl , racing over from right center , got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence , but he missed the ball . A fan sitting in the front row , wearing a mitt , reached up and caught the ball . Home run . Now I ' ve seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball , and that the fan ' s glove was essentially behind Darryl ' s . Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry . What cannot be disputed , however , is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it ; he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing . He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch . That exuberance disappeared immediately , however , when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man . All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference , and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game . Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch . Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park , but then relented and just relocated him to another area . In an interview after the game , Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss . Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don ' t care about winning . L . A . Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch . Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play . Was the fan wrong ? Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference ? Or was he human and just reacting ? By the way , he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible . Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games . I question what he was doing in right center with a left - handed pull hitter up and the game on the line . Had he been closer to the play , he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball . But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan . -- The Beastmaster\",\n",

       " \"There are several reasons for this difference . The main reason is that good hitters in their prime ( such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull ) are rarely regular DH ' s , even if they can ' t field ; it ' s more commonly a place to put aging veterans . Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly , getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field . I would expect such players to hit worse as DH ' s than they did during the rest of the season . A third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first or the outfield don ' t hit as well as DH ' s for some reason . Reggie Jackson was a good example ; in five years as a RF / DH for the Angels , he hit like the old Reggie when he was in right . The second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only ; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60 at DH will count only in the right fielders ' averages . This makes sense ; you might also look at it another way . Although the * average * offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left fielder , the * replacement - level * offensive performance is certainly lower ; if you are a left fielder but can ' t hit well enough to keep a job anywhere , then you certainly can ' t hit well enough to keep a job at DH .\",\n",

       " \"The Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as Vancouver outscored Winnipeg 3 - 2 . The pattern of the first game was repeated tonight , with the Canucks scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period , only to stave off a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent . The Jets looked more dangerous in this one but it didn ' t make a difference in the numbers that counted : goals . Vancouver ' s big line produced again , with centre Cliff Ronning and left winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to boost the Canucks to a 2 - 0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of Bautin and Ulanov . Mental lapses by the defence and goal - scoring talent in opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals . However , as in the first game , the Jets worked hard to take the game to the Canucks in the second period . The Jets dominated the second , checking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged by a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early . The hard work paid off late in the second , when Tie Domi caught Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make the score 2 - 1 . Domi ' s goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush to the Canuck ' s collapsing defence . The Canucks were unwilling to do anything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds . The Jets were allowed to set up and make plays . Both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably . McLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne while Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive . Selanne looked dangerous on the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck zone . The Canucks , on the other hand , looked like they were offering four checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead . A series of minor penalties at the end of the second period resulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third . The Jet ' s Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean ' s legs and into the net to tie the game at 2 - 2 . The Canuck ' s discordant play picked up where it left off . This was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected or were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight Winnipeg defence that were never supported . However , as in the first and second Canuck goals , a Jet defensive lapse ( re : bonehead play ) stalled the Winnipeg comeback . With the faceoff in the Winnipeg zone , Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with no Jet defender anywhere near him . Bure , who had been invisible in the game up to that point , took a rebound and managed to roof it with a backhand even though he was off balance . By then it was too late for the Jets to come back . Essensa made it to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing for their attack . Canucks 3 , Winnipeg 2 .

An outfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a lot of balls , preventing both singles and doubles , and also cut off more uncatchable balls , turinging doubles into singles .

It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn ' t very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of him . Sure Lemieux is a better player , but he is a different type of player . For a team to be successful , they need to have all types of players - this includes defensive forwards . When compared with other defensive forwards , Bob Gainey is the greatest defensive forward ever . He is the player who ' s talents best suited being a defensive forward - who completely dominated the game when he played . Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste his offensive talents and play defensively , he could have been a better defensive forward , but he wasn ' t .

Pre - game comments ----------------- Don \\' s pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies ... The goalie who gets back his all - star form ( Roy or Hextall ) can win the series for his team . Eposode Summary --------------- This episode took place rinkside . Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand . Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun . It featured a picture of Don , who just saw his shadow and proclaimed \" Will you look at dat , eh ? Means another 6 weeks of me . Beauty .\" Next , Don talked about the hot dog he was holding . According to him , the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL . From there , Don commented on the Quebec - Montreal game . The game had great flow , because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL . In contrast , the Calgary - LA game was terrible ... All stop - and - go , over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli . Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals . Next , Ron showed an old picture of Don , when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL . Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena ... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships . Finally , Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers . The rangers were a talented team who underachieved . Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith , who had several key injuries ( to Leetch and Patrick ) and goalies who went cold . Don had some criticism for the Rangers team ... The party \\' s over , Adolf ( Keenan ) is there .

       " 'Disclaimer -- This is for fun . In my computerized baseball game , I keep track of a category called \" stolen hits \", defined as a play made that \" an average fielder would not make with average effort .\" Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols ( Thanks Sherri !), I \\' ve figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen . Hits Stolen have been redefined as \" Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made .\" OK , I realize that \\' s unfair . Kurt \\' s probably the victim of pitching staff , fluke shots , and a monster park factor . But let \\' s put it this way : If we replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt \\' s 57 . 6 % out making ability , how many extra hits would go by ? To try and correlate it to reality a little more , I \\' ve calculated Net Hits Stolen , based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make . By the same method I \\' ve calculated Net Double Plays , and Net Extra Bases ( doubles and triples let by ). Finally , I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution , or DCON :->. Basically , it represents the defensive contribution of a player . I add this number to OPS to get DOPS ( Defense + Onbase Plus Slug ), which should represent the player \\' s total contribution to the team . So don \\' t take it too seriously . The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article . The short version -- definition of terms HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB -- Net Extra Bases -- Extra bases prevented compared to avg . fielder DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented , as a rate .

       " \"As the Sharks ' season came to a close tonight , I will start a series of posts , trying to revisit the players , the trades , the moves , etc ., that went through for the Sharks for the past season . If you are uninterested , since I will have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings , you can kill them . I will first try to evaluate how the players did . These ratings , of course , are subject to my own biases , but I hope that I can try to be as objective as possible . I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks and / or did not play for another NHL team this season . Thus , then , let ' s go to the goaltenders ... # 1 BRIAN HAYWARD Season : 11th Acquired : ' 91 - 92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : P ( D ) It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end , a career that featured sharing three Jennings Trophies ( with Patrick Roy , in ' 87 , ' 88 , and ' 89 ). It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade ( and skip the letter grading ), but he had simply been awful on ice this year , save for a bright spot or two , and even if he had been healthy , he would not be any more than the 3rd - string goalie . But Hayward was a classy individual , who also figured in on the Sharks ' first ever victory , the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames . As he retires , the fans will remember what a good guy he was . # 30 JEFF HACKETT Season : 3rd Acquired : ' 91 - 92 , from N . Y . Islanders in expansion draft Grade : C Hackett , after ( deservedly ) winning the team MVP honors last season , simply wasted the year . Other than a few good spots ( 57 saves against Los Angeles , almost - shutout against Tampa Bay , etc .), Hackett , finishing with 85 . 6 % save percentage and a 5 . 28 GAA , watched his status go from the team ' s # 1 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season . He was expected , early , to carry the team along ; instead , he apparently became frustrated , but the an early injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor , but upon return , he simply wasn ' t up to the task . He may not return next year . # 31 WADE FLAHERTY Season : 1st ( still eligible as rookie ) Acquired : ' 91 - 92 , signed as undrafted free agent Grade : I ( A -) It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone , thus the incomplete grade , but yet in the one start that he did get ( against the Calgary Flames ), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods . He started the season poorly in Kansas City , but finished strong , prompting the Blades ' owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP honors . The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the NHL ; last year , he was a capable backup for Arturs Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs , picking up all - star honors along with Irbe ; now it ' s time for him to show that he can share the job with Irbe next year , because with prospects Dan Ryder , Trevor Robins , and Scott Cashman coming along , if he doesn ' t make it next year , he may not ever . # 32 ARTURS IRBE Season : 1st Acquired : ' 91 - 92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : B + I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that he ' s a bona fide NHL goaltender , perhaps a bona fide # 1 goaltender . He has provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had , getting the team ' s first ever shut - out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26 . He has been fearless in and out of the net , aggressively playing the puck and making passes , reminding people of a young Ron Hextall ( except , of course , the goonism ). Yet he still needs to develop more consistency , which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him , but if the Sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season , Irbe ' s the key , as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts .\",\n",
       " 'NESN owns the rights to Bruin telecasts . I suspect that NESN was only going to sell one telecast to ESPN ( remember , ESPN only owns exclusive rights to the FINALS , not the entire playoffs ). Since ESPN bought the SCA contract , there are less wrangles to untie with showing the Devils and Penguins . I think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it . Plus they have no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule unless the NHL was willing to make a western club move up their game . I think the NHL got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for ABC .

       " \"This comes up periodically , and I just don ' t get it . Take , for example , Mark McGwire . He walked 90 times in 1993 . If that ' s not a potential great example of what you ' re talking about then I don ' t know what is . Now let ' s look at what happens when McGwire doesn ' t walk : 75 % of the time he made an out . 10 % of the time he hit a single . 5 % of the time he hit a double . 10 % of the time he hit a homer . Now , you ' re pitching against McGwire . Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers , 1 double , 2 singles , and 15 outs ? I would . Why give him the base when you can get him out 3 times out of 4 ? Then there are guys like Alex Cole , who has a career . 363 OBP even though he ' s never had a batting average over . 300 ( he did hit . 300 in 227 AB in 1990 ) or hit a single home run . Yep , that ' s right , he ' s * never * hit a homer in 916 AB ' s through the end of 1992 . Who ' d be afraid to throw a strike to him ?

       " \"No . Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost , and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec won . Everybody said it would come down to goaltending , that goaltending was the key , etc etc . Well , the key doesn ' t quite fit if you ' re Montreal . The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call , but let ' s face it ; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow . Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow . He even saw the whole shot , dammit . Besides , Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT . Montreal played a solid game ( although they still don ' t know how to clear traffic in front of the net ; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more ). Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2 - goal lead with less than five , let alone two , minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads . But I don ' t think this was a team loss ( although Keane should have been able to clear the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal ). Roy is paid big money to play . He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic ' s shot . Demers should start Racicot in the next game . If not that , he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two .... and maybe this article , if possible . I didn ' t think the wrap - around was as bad as the second goal . I also didn ' t think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender ( can ' t remember who ) in the first place . But you are correct , it shouldn ' t have gone in regardless . Yep . Moog looked bad on Mogilny ' s goal with five seconds left in the second , IMO . How about Neely though ? Holy shit , what a player . Speaking of great players , man - oh - man can Quebec skate . I haven ' t seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time . Watching them break out of their zone , especially Sundin , is a treat to watch . They remind me of the Red Army . But I still hate the team . On the rest of the games : Didn ' t St . Louis ' winning goal come on a powerplay ? Penalties will cost Chicago dearly , especially against Detroit . Same goes for Calgary ; very , very undisciplined . When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to * avoid * fights , you know something ' s up . New Jersey was overmatched , Terreri ' s heroics notwithstanding . Mario is unbelievable , and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs . But I hate that team anyway .\",\n",

While the exact details are not known , it is believed to concern the Oiler ' s future . Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement with Copps Collesium in Hamilton . During the press conference , Pocklington may announce the deal . It is quite possible that the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium . Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $ 65 million earlier , but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington .\",\n",

Selanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump , scoring two powerplay goals , and one on a nice breakaway pass from Darrin Shannon .

       " \"Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are finally moving in the right direction . They should finish over . 500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race in August . However , I would take back a few moves : 1 . The Jim Abbott Trade . I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person , but a great pitcher also . He could win the Cy Young this year , but he won ' t because the right side of the Yanks infield isn ' t good enough . So why was this not a good trade ? JT Snow . How many rookies have been able to step in and immediately have the impact that he has had so far on the Angels ? I know it ' s early , but if you ' ve seen this kid hit , field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be a tremendous player . The Yanks should have kept him . What about Mattingly , you ask ? Well - it ' s great that the Yanks have taken care of him and remained loyal , but he ' s 10 years older than Snow and just doesn ' t have the same bat speed as before his back injury . It ' s a shame , but as a Yankee fan who wants to see the * best * Yankee team , I ' d take Snow over Mattingly at first . The Yanks also gave up two promising propects with Snow for Abbott . Besides , with Domingo Jean , Brien taylor , Wickman , Militello , and Sterling Hitchcock , they are just loaded with propects . I know Abbotts only 26 , but this was too much to give up . I believe George forced this trade because he believes ( and he ' s right ) that Abbott will be a big hit in NY . However , I ' d like to see the Yankees build a baseball team , not an amusement show . 2 . Wade Boggs . I live in Boston and like Wade a lot . But , his career is winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop a long term solution ( i . e . Hensley Muelins , Russ Davis , Velarde ?). Besides , Wade just doesn ' t have any range . What a shame about Charlie Hayes , huh ? 3 . Spike Owen . See Wade Boggs . I ' d much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri or whoever . Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1 / 2 point . And these guys are on the down sides of their careers . 4 . Danny Tartabull . Yes - he ' s put up some tremendous numbers and it ' s nice to think about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year . But he never is . We should expect 120 games max out of him . Meanwhile , Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O ' Neil is playing left field ! I believe O ' Neil led NL outfielders in assists last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder . What I ' m basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right direction but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year . They should ( at the GM level ) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series . This means getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they will be ready in a year or two . I ' m afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner . Certainly , the Boggs deal was all George . It looks like George is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now . The veterans are always available and can be added at any time ( like Boston did this year ). Develop the young players first , then add the one or two veterans ( or in the Yankees case , just keep them ). Let ' s all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn ' t dismantle the terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee organization back into one of respect . I ' m really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today ( relief pitching for example ). George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away . Have patience George and we will all enjoy the future . Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it ' s baseball hell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time !\",\n",
       " 'Oops ! I came across this file from last year . Thought you might enjoy some of these thoughts . The predictions were made on the date indicated . They are largely out of order . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ June 11 , 1992 tedward @ cs . cornell . edu ( ME !) You all know how things turned out . The Orioles , Red Sox , and Yankees all disappeared . The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the expected pace . The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half . The Rangers predictably took a dive . That shouldn \\' t have surprised anybody . Meanwhile , as predicted , the Mariners dropped behind the Angels and Royals . They clearly didn \\' t deserve the 22 - 33 record in June . The White Sox and A \\' s upped their game a bit , while the Twins dropped off a little . But for the most part things were as expected . Okay , so there were a few blatant errors . But for a predictive calculation , I thought this did pretty well . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ From CAVGEOE @ YaleVM . YCC . Yale .

Showalter is still around ( and likely to stick , it seems ). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ From mattel . Auto - trol .

Nope . I guess this is why you picked the Mets to win , huh ? Tsk Tsk . Not nice to predict something like this . You got that right ! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ And my response ... Okay , so the Mets finished fifth . But I got the Pirates and Expos right ! First half ? Dead on ! Second half ? Ummm .... I \\' m a Sox fan , go easy on me ! So I got my predictions for Gooden and Saberhagen reversed . :-) I was at least * close *, and was right about Jefferies . ( Though I don \\' t know . HAS WFAN criticized the Jefferies trade ?) Close . No cigar . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Some predictions need no introduction ! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Sometimes us statheads get lucky . Grace * didn \\' t * hit behind Dawson the entire season , but he also finished with only 79 RBIs . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Nope . He slowed down , and the injury finished him off . Didn \\' t even reach 50 . But a ballsy prediction , nonetheless . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ From ECAXRON @ MARS . LERC . NASA . GOV Thu May 21 16 : 42 : 21 1992 The Orioles finished seven games out . None of them won 20 ( though Mussina might have had a chance , with better relief and more starts ). Except for the Brewers ( who you probably forgot ), you were right ! The rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre . The Yankees and Indians \" led \" with 76 wins , the Red Sox \" trailed \" with 73 wins . None were horrible , but four were five or more games below . 500 . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ From : djohnson @ cayley . uwaterloo . ca ( David Johnson ) Date : Thu , 6 Aug 1992 15 : 47 : 30 GMT You win ! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ From king @ cogsci .

She has won an Emmy for research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary ( which I know from nothing but which sounds good ). She said that among other things , Berg was the principal spy for the OSS ( CIA ' s WWII precursor ) spying on Axis atomic programs , because of his physics background and language skills . She said that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland , and had instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb research ( he concluded they were two years behind , and didn ' t shoot him ). ( I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb program , but I don ' t know how reliable this is .) Unfortunately , NPR didn ' t mention any kind of a book she ' s writing -- I ' d certainly buy it . ( In case you ' re wondering about baseball relevance , Berg was a longtime MLB backup catcher . He was a member of an MLB All - Star team that toured Japan in 1934 , presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because he was one of the few Americans , much less MLB players , who spoke Japanese . Photos he took of Tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids , according to McCarthy .)\",\n",

       " 'The FLYERS blew a 3 - 0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period , but Kevin Dineen \\' s 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win , 7 - 4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row . Alexander Mogilny led the comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd . Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots on goal to improve his own record to 20 - 17 - 6 as he was tested by Mogilny and LaFontaine all night . Roster move : Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey , Shawn Cronin was a healthy scratch . Lines : Eklund - Lindros - Recchi Beranek - Brind \\' Amour - Dineen Lomakin - Butsayev - Conroy Faust - Acton - Brown Galley - Bowen Yushkevich - Hawgood Carkner - McGill Tommy Soderstrom Game Summary : Say , if anybody from Buffalo is reading this , where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems ? We had to turn down the volume ! The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the first period . They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods . Maybe Tommy told them that he was getting bored back there ... Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it . After Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped , Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to Eric 1 / 2 way up on his left . Eric dropped it to Galley , and he sent it ahead to Recchi steaming out of the zone . Mark skated into the center circle , passed the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik , skated around him and in on Fuhr . Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick , Recchi drifted right , drifted back left , and slid the puck back to the right past Fuhr for a 1 - 0 FLYERS lead at 0 : 18 . It was so beautiful Eric and Garry should turn down their assists :-). The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that , but he was strong and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage . The game then became a defensive struggle for a while . The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10 : 26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into the boards in the FLYERS zone . LaFontaine got the only scoring chance , and not a terribly good one , as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play . Mogilny got a post after it was over . The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS . Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13 : 31 for taking down Mark Recchi to give the FLYERS a power play . The best penalty killing team in the league didn \\' t allow the FLYERS a shot on goal , although the FLYERS did create a good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot . Towards the end of the period the play started going end to end , but everybody kept missing the net . Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18 : 19 to give the Sabres another power play , but they couldn \\' t get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure , particularly when they iced the puck . Shots were 8 - 6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6 - 2 at one point . Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods . Jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs , but not discouraged . This was considered a rebuilding year after * The Trade * and he seemed very happy with the way the season went . When asked if he agonized over * The Trade * he said that it was Russ Farwell \\' s trade and not his , that it only was an issue for him and Ed Snider as far as the money . But yes , there was some agonizing , and they \\' d do it all over again . When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it \\' s Russ \\' call , and Russ will evaluate things at the end of the season . He feels that they \\' re 3 years away from a shot at the Cup . He expects to get into the playoffs next year , have a shot at a division title the following year , and a shot at the finals the year after that . This based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer . He \\' s very happy with the re - alignment ( he called it \" outstanding \"). Happy with the current expansion , feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of Europeans , but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable . Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics ( booo ) but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus . The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May took a tripping penalty at 0 : 51 of the second . The FLYERS had a little trouble getting started , but eventually did . Hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres blue line along the right boards . Eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle . He half fanned on it , and sent the puck trickling through the slot . Fuhr didn \\' t know where it was , though , and Hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2 : 15 . Then Mogilny on a breakaway . He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line and went in on Soderstrom . He went with the backhander , but Soderstrom was all over it . The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them . Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor , then according to Gary Dornhoefer took a dive to get the other ( there was no video ) at 4 : 22 . The Sabres coudln \\' t get started . Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the FLYERS zone , and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and headed the other way . It started out a 1 on 1 , but Brind \\' Amour hustled ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman . Dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3 - 0 FLYERS at 5 : 40 . That was all for Fuhr , John Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over . But the Sabres still had lots of power play time . Again they took some time to just get into the FLYERS zone , and when they finally did the FLYERS were all over them . Boos began to ring through the building . But they finally got through Soderstrom on an ugly goal . Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot . Hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it . Mistake # 1 , he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about A ) the rebound or B ) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net . Well , the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom , and mistake # 2 , Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie . He didn \\' t even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away . With the goal , at 7 : 48 , two streaks end for the FLYERS . 150 : 28 of shutout hockey , and 27 straight penalty kills . Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8 : 36 with a high sticking minor , I think it was Barnaby again . This time the Sabres were able to get set up quickly , but couldn \\' t get too much quality on goal . The Sabres continued to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended . Things evetually settled down , but then the other very bad penalty . McGill allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff . The gloves were dropped , and McGill started pounding the crap out of him . But during the fight , he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet , and that meant a match penalty . 2 for slashing , 5 fighting and 5 for the major , 7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14 : 15 , Barnaby only got 5 . The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while , but there was only so long they could do that . After a couple of good Sabre chances , Audette handed to Ledyard at the point , and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by Soderstrom . LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net , and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right . Soderstrom had moved over to play LaFontaine , and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men , Wood just slid it into the empty net at 17 : 34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3 - 2 . LaFontaine was actually trying to put it on net , but half fanned on it and got a break . The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone , but Hasek was strong . Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the neutral zone , and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS blue line . Another mini - breakaway for Mogilny , he elected to shoot from the left circle , and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 18 : 56 for his 75th of the season . Ironically , the youth hockey tip between the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off angles ... That was all in the 2nd , shots were 19 - 7 Sabres . Into the 3rd period , and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the FLYERS the lead back . A 2 on 1 , Acton with the puck , he dropped to Eklund in the slot , and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from . When he finally did shoot , he hit the far post . That was still during the carryover power play time . Than an incredible almost goal . Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood untouched into Soderstrom . Soderstrom goes down , Wood pokes the puck under Soderstrom , and a black object hits the back of the net . Red light comes on , horn sounds , crowd cheers . But up to the video replay booth , for some strange reason , and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing . Well , it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net , not the puck . Emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net ... Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2 : 35 . The FLYERS could not get anything going at all . They finally got set up 1 / 2 way through , but were kept on the perimeter . As time ran out , Beranek stripped the puck from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to Eklund at the top of the left circle . Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him . Dineen fumbled the pass , but twice directed it at Hasek , and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4 : 42 . 4 - 3 FLYERS . But the Sabres came right back . LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net . Erry started to skate out , but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net . Mogilny flew in , skated around , and stuffed it through Soderstrom \\' s 5 hole for his 76th at 5 : 24 to tie the game at 4 . Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5 : 55 . The FLYERS set up in the Sabres zone , and stayed there . Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in the middle . While Brind \\' Amour wrestled for the puck , Dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek \\' s glove side at 6 : 44 . Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8 : 19 . The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone . Brind \\' Amour and Ledyard went after it , and Rod got the puck . He backed away from the right boards , skated to the right faceoff dot , and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing through the slot all by himself . Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of Hasek for a 6 - 4 FLYERS lead at 8 : 39 . 3rd hat trick of the season for Dineen , 7th of his career , 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season . Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9 : 02 to kill the rest of the Sabres power play . Not much action on the 4 on 4 , and the Sabres got most of the chances on the FLYERS resulting power play . Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves . The Sabres weren \\' t able to pull Hasek as time was running out as the FLYERS wouldn \\' t allow any consistant possession for the Sabres . Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and Brind \\' Amour stripped it away from him . He pulled away and found Dineen on the other side of the left circle , and Dineen found Acton at the right of Hasek . He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders , and Acton chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19 : 48 on his 35th birthday . That was all the scoring , shots were 18 - 13 Buffalo , and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game . So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn \\' t been tested much in his last couple of starts . Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night ( unless he had a better night earlier in the season , but I don \\' t think so ). The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years , 30 goals for only 11 against with three shutouts . Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games with injury . 4 points out of 4th , clinched 5th place since the Rangers lose the tie breaker . A couple misc notes : Forget the Mike Keenan rumors , there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year . In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award , but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman . The Times of Trenton has reported that \" a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma \" has looked over Tommy Soderstrom \\' s medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future . Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year . His response was that he wants to come back , he feels he did a good job this year , but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if Farwell didn \\' t want him back .

The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds . There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better . Clayton ' s defense has been superb . McGee seems to like leading off this year . Manwaring is driving the ball . So on & so forth . I hope it continues ... I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real -- particularly the pitching .

My personal favorite move ( I ' m a goalie too ) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back of their skates when the ref isn ' t looking . Makes ' em go down like a ton of bricks , but doesn ' t cause injuries unless they don ' t know how to fall ( I ' m talking about hitting the blades here , not the foot ). It also makes the player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty . Unfortunately , it also leaves your blocker out of position for a short time ... I don ' t do this if a shot is likely on the short side . Hmm .... maybe I should mail Potvin this method ( in French and with helpful diagrams , of course ).

       " \"Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains . Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced to give it up ( Ramsey ' s now a Penguin ). Ramsey inherited it from Mike Foligno ( who ' s now a leaf ). He in turn had inherited it from Lindy Ruff , who went I forget where . Ruff had it from Perreault , who retired , so I guess that ' s where the streak started . Or did it ? After all , Danny Gare was captain before him , and he went to Detroit . Jim Scoenfeld , Gerry Meehan , and Floyd Smith are the others , in reverse order , last to first . I was a bit young at the time , so I ' m not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld , but he ultimately went to Detroit and Boston . Meehan went to Vancouver , Atlanta and Washington . Smith seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo , but I don ' t know if the captaincy was removed before or after that , or how many games he played for Buffalo . This is actually getting fascinating . :-) Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you ' re to be traded , almost , unless you ' re a franchise player .\",\n",

       " \"I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points . However , I think you approached this the wrong way . I believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does . I feel they were all much better players . I am not saying I fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more . IMHO Dave Kingman - definately not . They guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag . The rest of his career I do not think he was very feared by pitchers . I also do not think he did a lot for the game . I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I still would not back him for the Hall of Fame . Dave Winfield - I think so . He is feared by pitchers , he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are ( in my opinion - without stats ) better than Kingman ' s ( probably by quite a bit ). I also perceive him to be a leader , maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader . I think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society . Examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done ( I know some of this from when he was with the Yankees ). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I think it deserves some consideration . Lee Smith - Maybe , I would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of Kingman . Darrell Evans - No . Eddie Murray - Maybe , He has had a very good career , he is a leader ( although a silent one ), he is a good role model . Are the stats good enough ? I am not sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman ' s both the average as well as the power numbers ( but not as good as Winfield ' s ). Just think , Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years . Jeff Reardon - My guess is no , but it kind of depends on his numbers . Off the top of my head I would take Lee Smith first . Well , I strongly disagree here . Both of these guys deserve it for sure . I talked about leadership above , both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season . Robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers offensively . The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have shattered Aaron ' s home run mark by now . How many of those great plays saved games ? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game ? While I believe both of these guys have numbers , baseball is about more than numbers ( or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers ). Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame . As does George Brett who also belongs in this class of player . Steve Garvey - I am not sure , probably not but I guess I could see someone making a case for him . Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might bring up his name . Kirby Puckett - Probably . The only reason I do not say definately is he still has time left in his career . If he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately . Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt ? I think I heard something about him having some 53 records ( maybe they were not all good - I don ' t know I did not hear any of them just the number ). He has the numbers , he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model . I would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game ( probably not even top 20 ) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame because of his accomplishments ( no - hitters , strikeouts , respectable numbers - even with some weaker teams ) you can go on and on . I really hope he gets ALL the possible votes . So in summing up I have 3 groups , those that belong , those that probably do but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don ' t belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go . Yes - Winfield , Yount , Brett ( not in your mail ), O . Smith , Puckett and Ryan Maybe - Murray and L . Smith No - Reardon , Garvey , Morris , Evans and definately Kingman As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions .\",\n",

I think the team ' s attendence and play was clearly in an upward trend , which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in deciding to move .

       " '4 / 23 / 93 BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN , LEAD SERIES 3 - 0 ----------------------------------------------------- It was a great atmosphere last night at the St . Louis Arena as Joseph and the Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game . People were cheering the Blues long before face - off time , and they kept going for the entire game . My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning hours with some of the players . Here \\' s a game summary from the St . Louis Post - Disptach . Enjoy ... By Dave Luecking Of The Post - Dispatch Staff : At 10 : 24 p . m . Friday night , The Arena crowd of 17 , 965 paid homage to Blues goalie Curtis Joseph . The fans began bowing , their arms extended , taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read `` Only God Saves More Than Joseph .\" It was a fitting tribute to Joseph , who has brought the Blues to the verge of a surprising sweep . Joseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday , blanking the Blackhawks 3 - 0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3 - 0 lead in the best - of - seven series . The Blackhawks haven \\' t scored against Joseph since the 8 : 51 mark of the second period of Game 1 . Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds , a Blues record . Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146 : 28 , set in the first round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers , one of only two series the Blues have sweeped in their history . The Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4 , a nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday . The Blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history , both in 1969 , when they swept Philadelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals . The shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to make 47 saves . This time , the Blues held the shots down to 34 , and the Blackhawks couldn \\' t touch Joseph . Well , they touched Joseph , numerous times , shoving him and pushing him at every opportunity to try to get him off his game . But Joseph and the Blues were unfazed , dishing out their own punishment along the way . The Blues \\' grinders -- Bob Bassen , Rich Sutter , Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry -- wore down the Blackhawks , taking the visitors from Chicago off their game . The grinders set the stage for the glamour boys , the gifted playmakers and scorers , who made the most of their opportunities . Craig Janney , Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored , getting one goal in each period . Hull assisted on Janney \\' s first - period power play goal after two unwise Chicago penalties . Checker Miller set up Hull \\' s goal in the second period , and rookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson , who scored at 16 : 44 of the final period . Blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling `` Sweep . Sweep . Sweep .\" They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour `` Bell - Four . Bell - Four .\" They also chanted `` Na , na - na - na , hey - hey good bye .\" Such talk is a tad premature . There \\' s still one game left , but the Blues are on a roll . They have the Blackhawks on their heels . The Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play . Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment , and Brendan Shanahan dumped Steve Smith at center ice . Chicago tried to retaliate , but Troy Murray \\' s decision to run into Joseph backfired . Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty . The Blues didn \\' t get a shot on goal on the power play , and they survived a scare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to Steve Larmer . Joseph stopped Larmer \\' s shot and everything else Chicago threw at him in the first period . The \\' Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low , where Joseph \\' s butterfly style is deadly . Rookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two shots on goal , as many as Miller . The Blues \\' penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour . Marouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up . He caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican \\' s third penalty . He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14 : 58 , and gave the Blues a two - man advantage 1 : 07 later when Christian Ruuttu slashed Shanahan . The Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play , and Hull got it where he likes it -- in the high slot . Hull \\' s shot hit Belfour \\' s right shoulder , and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line . Belfour dived back to cover , but the puck squirted loose to Janney , who poked it into the net at 16 : 53 for his first goal of the playoffs . The Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended , and the Blackhawks lost their composure . Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds remaining in the period , and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by shooting the puck into the Blues \\' bench . Chris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice , and Marouelli slapped him with a 10 - minute misconduct . Chicago survived the Blues \\' power play , but the loss of Chelios hurt . He didn \\' t return until the midway point of the period , and within three minutes of his return , Hull had increased the Blues \\' lead to 2 - 0 , deflecting in Miller \\' s crisp pass . Try as they might , the Blackhawks couldn \\' t get to Joseph , who stopped everything they could throw at him . He stopped 12 shots in the second period and 13 more in the third . Chicago also hit the goalpost twice . Emerson \\' s goal put the game away . He went hard to the net and redirected Felsner \\' s pass .',\n",

Ville Siren \\' s slap shot from the blue line on power play made it 1 - 1 , and Juha Riihijarvi scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal put the puck high over Aslin , 1 - 2 after the first period . The Finns started the second period with really good pressure . Korpisalo made it 1 - 3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin . Then , during the Finnish pressure , Sweden turned the game around in 1 : 47 . Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal , and passed the puck to Jan Larsson in front , who backhanded the puck low , 2 - 3 . Rundqvist entered the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund , and the Finnish defense let Ahlund skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal , 3 - 3 . Next , Roger Hansson - behind the goal - sent the puck back to the blue line where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn \\' t see the puck since there was traffic in front , 4 - 3 . Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \" the Shadow \" Nilsson . Stefan and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone , Patrik passed the puck back to Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake , 5 - 3 . Then , Keijo Sailynoja show started . He reduce and equalized the lead in only 21 seconds ! First he scored the 5 - 4 goal , and after that he came in alone with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot . Sailynoja made a nice penalty shot , showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot . The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6 - 5 goal late in the game on a nice power play combination . Renberg waited in the slot , showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side , Ahlund passed the puck and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer \\' s goal \\' s far side . But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the game \\' s final goal to make it 6 - 6 . Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow angle that - maybe - Aslin should have saved . All in all , a decent game where the defense wasn \\' t the best . Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period to try no combinations . Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team . Larsson - Nilsson - Juhlin best line overall again , it seems to be a working WC line . Stillman good on defense . Some players aren \\' t good enough for the WC though . Hakan Ahlund ( faell ner hjaelmen och jobba !), Roger Hansson , Challe Berglund , Kenny Jonsson will likely have to leave for NHL pros . Two - goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the Finnish team . Markus Ketterer didn \\' t have a very good game , we \\' ve seen him a lot better , so Lindfors is probably Finland \\' s starting goalie in the WC . I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team . It would be inter - resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Starting lines : SWEDEN FINLAND 35 .

       " 'Let \\' s be careful here . If players \\' performance was completely random in ( Clutch - No Clutch ), then you would still expect some players to be good in the clutch every year and some to be not - so - good every year . With two years worth of data , you \\' d have 1 / 4 of the players good each year , 1 / 4 bad each year , and 1 / 2 would have one good and one bad year . We have 96 players for 5 years (\\' 84 -\\' 88 ). Just flipping a coin , you \\' d expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year . This is what we actually get -- No . of good years 0 1 2 3 4 5 Clutch performers 4 10 37 24 18 3 Coin flip ( random ) 3 15 30 30 15 3 Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process leading to deviations from non - clutch performance was completely random . If there was anything to clutch hitting ( at least in this definition ) that had any predictive capability , you expect to see the number of players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping a coin . Further , if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above or below average in clutch situations ( say , 1 standard deviation from the mean ) more than one year , the random explanation still looks good . In the four years (\\' 84 -\\' 87 ) that I looked at the data from Elias , there were 79 ( 29 ) players with a minimum of 25 ( 50 ) at bats in clutch situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years . Of those 79 ( 29 ) players , 38 ( 14 ) of them changed sign between the two years . In other words , they were great clutch hitters one year and really horrible the other year . If it was just a random process , you \\' d expect those numbers to be 39 . 5 ( 14 . 5 ). Everything that \\' s been measured about clutch hitting over a period of years that could be used to predict any ability with any proposed definition has looked like a random process ( with the caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage that could be dragged out of the data -- e . g ., John Lowenstein probably never had a \" clutch \" AB against a left - handed pitcher , but he might well have had some in blowouts , so that there would be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his platoon advantage ). This is not a subject that has been glanced at casually . A lot of people have put a lot of effort into studying it and every one of them , with the exception of the Elias study , has been unable to find anything that would allow you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better than flipping a coin . ( Self - serving plug follows : some of the flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth - coming SABR book , _The Perfect Game_ , by Taylor Publishing .

However , Alomar had a higher Defensive Average . So who would be better ? Using Alomar ' s opportunities ( 469 groundballs , 73 possible double plays ) Alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 DPs . Baerga would have had ( with same DA & DP %) 328 groundouts and 35 DPs . Using Baerga ' s opportunites ( 545 groundballs , 99 possible double plays ).

But you ' re creating a scoring opportunity where there might not have been one before . I can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls , but it ' s obviously easier to score in basketball , there are more opportunities . If a basketball team scores 100 points , that ' s at least fifty chances made . The average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game ( and this is a total guess ) is probably around 40 , and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe 5 of them . You have some good ideas concerning the other penalties , but I think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with . Also , later in the post , you talked about how boring the NBA game you attended was , that play was stopped too often .

       " \"For your information , Lankford is injured ( I think it is his shoulder or rib cage ), so he could not use him as a pinch hitter . I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards . He does not have too much offensive capabilities , but he is an awesome defensively . Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense ?:) I forgot who St . Louis gave up for him , but it was not too much . As far as Gilkey is concerned , he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan , who beat him out . I expect to see a Gilkey / Jordan platoon in LF . I agree with you on this one . As soon as Larkin threw that ball , I knew that Lankford was a dead bird . But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make a perfect throw ? I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball . Don ' t forget the overachieving Cards of ' 91 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place ( although they were oveshadowed by the Braves / Twins last to first climb ). He won a division title , and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the Braves ( why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I will never understand ). With Torre at the controls , the Cardinals are heading in the right direction . One more thing , one game does not make a season . Yes , they lost to the Reds , but with the second best pitching staff in the National League ( first in the East ), and a pretty good offense , the Redbirds will win a lot more than they lose .

Sounds like they would be just as well off - or better - if he played the solid two - way game that our friends in Finland claim he is capable of . But if he did that he wouldn ' t be chal - lenging for the league lead in goals would he ? The Bi - Planes might be challenging for first however ... Now let ' s see ... you have compared Timo to Anderson and Cullen . Who ' s next ? Mike Foligno ? Some of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he can play a solid two - way game . I would have to say that this style of contribution would be more conducive to winning . Or don ' t you think so ? I don ' t believe it ! You did compare him to Foligno ! ( And I honestly hadn ' t read this far ). It would help if you used a little discrimination in your thinking . Your contributions would be more highly valued if we could see that you weren ' t trying to be merely argumentative . cordially , as always , rm\",\n",

       " \"Usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor uniform change per season , but the past few seasons have been incredible . Any thoughts on the new ( old ) Reds uniforms . I remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card , and unless I miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds . The Mets ( HOW ABOUT DOC ' S PERFORMANCE TODAY ?!!!!!) have reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder , and changed the Mets insgnia on the front of the jersey . To my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962 , and it reminds me a little of the Dodger logo . Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform , or at least uniforms that look more traditional . ( Phillies , Reds , Expos , White Sox , Padres , etc .) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray . The trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years , as opposed to the cookie - cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties . With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs , no one in the comissioner ' s office , and inter - league play on the horizon , it ' s nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be .\",\n",

       " 'By Dave Luecking Of The Post - Dispatch Staff At 9 : 11 Thursday night , the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer . Their cheer quickly turned into a roar , and finally , the sellout crowd of 17 , 816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff - bound Blues . The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5 , Stars 3 . With the North Stars \\' loss , the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division . Good thing , because the Blues quit playing . They held a 5 - 1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit - Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period . They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6 - 5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer . Tampa \\' s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers , but officiating supervisor John D \\' Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired . `` I \\' m glad I didn \\' t see it go in at the end ,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said . If the goal had counted , he \\' d have been more upset than he was by the Blues \\' disappearance in the final 24 minutes . Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry \\' s anger . `` It wasn \\' t pretty at the end ,\" he said . `` We played 36 , 37 great minutes , as good as we played all year . It slipped away at the end . It shouldn \\' t have , but it did .\" Still , the Blues won , prompting another ovation from the crowd at game \\' s end . Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season , the Blues still made the playoffs . They \\' ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best - of - seven Norris Division semifinal , beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium . The Blues finished the regular - season with a record of 37 - 36 - 11 for 85 points , their fourth consecutive plus -. 500 season . Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place , with a record of 36 - 38 - 10 for 82 points . Tampa Bay , which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2 - 2 at Tampa , ended its first season with a record of 23 - 54 - 7 for 53 points . The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room . Instead , the mood was one of relief and some disappointment . `` It \\' s a shame we let down ,\" said Kevin Miller , one of three Blues to score two goals . Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others . `` There was no need for a letdown . If we \\' d have kept working , it would have ended 6 - 2 and everyone would be happy .\" Instead , a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs . `` We won , and that \\' s all that matters ,\" said Brett Hull , scoreless and minus - 3 for the night . `` Once we got up 4 - 0 , it was really tough to play .\" Some players didn \\' t have a problem . `` Just because the score was announced , our line didn \\' t quit ,\" said Rich Sutter , who played with Bassen and Miller . `` We still had a game to play . You can \\' t allow five goals like we did , that \\' s not right . `` It was disappointing to see what was going on .\" Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues \\' effort . Somehow , he missed the announcement of Minnesota \\' s loss . `` I didn \\' t know it was final ,\" he said . `` I was kind of looking around on the bench . I didn \\' t realize it was a final for some reason . We \\' re in the playoffs , and that \\' s great , but it \\' s a little disappointing to play like we did at the end .\" The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota - Detroit score off of the board . The score showed 0 - 0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4 - 2 in the third period . The Blues already led 4 - 0 at the time . `` I told them I didn \\' t want to see the score , I didn \\' t want to know the score ,\" Berry said . `` I felt we had to win the game , and that \\' s the approach we took .\" If Minnesota took a lead , Berry feared , the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues . If Detroit led , he worried , the Blues might quit . Until the announcement , the Blues played splendidly . Shanahan got the crowd going at 10 : 44 of the first period , scoring his 50th of the season . Then , Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period . With the teams playing four on four , Miller broke in on left wing , deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21 . 6 seconds remaining in the period . Then , just 10 . 5 seconds later , Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone . Bassen made it 4 - 0 just 14 seconds into the second period , scoring on the rebound of Bret Hedican \\' s shot . The goal gave him his first two - goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend . Last year , Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill , who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb . 23 . `` I was thinking of my buddy Oliver ,\" Bassen said . `` He \\' s in heaven now , and I know he was watching . I know he \\' s happy .\" Miller increased the Blues lead to 5 - 0 on a break - away goal set up by Zombo at 11 : 09 . Then , Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph \\' s shutout just 18 seconds later , making it 5 - 1 . Less than a minute after the North Stars \\' final was announced , Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5 - 2 . But Shanahan scored his 51st , converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21 . 3 seconds remaining in the second period . Then , it was all Lightning . Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period , prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph . Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1 : 21 midway through the third period . The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan \\' s second goal stand up as the winner . `` We were in there ,\" Shanahan said . `` The game was over . We were in .\"',\n",
       " \"And Fleury is no enforcer . An agitator for sure , but Fleury never has and never will have a fight , which seems to be what you ' re saying Wood is . The closest Fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against Los Angeles . There was a scrum and McSorley pinched Fleury ' s head under his arm . Fleury dropped his gloves and gave McSorley a weak shot to the side of the head . McSorely , knowing a good thing when he saw one , popped Fleury one right between the eyes . End of fight .

       " \"- - I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton . - Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference - next week . While the exact details are not known , it is believed - to concern the Oiler ' s future . - - Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement - with Copps Collesium in Hamilton . During the press conference , - Pocklington may announce the deal . It is quite possible that - the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to - renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium . - - Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $ 65 million earlier , - but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington . - - As for me , my opinion is divided ... Edmonton has been fairly - supportive of the Oilers . Even though they ' re a small market - team , they had many sellouts in the 80s . Even with the problems - that the team had this year , they still brought in more fans - than many teams in larger cities did . On the other hand , if - the team does move , there is no place more deserving than - Hamilton . Of course , how would that affect the grand - realignment scheme of Bettman ? - Following up on this , the provincial government has been asked by the Opposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton . The government said that Pock is going nowhere ! Why don ' t I believe the government ? Wasn ' t it Pocklington who wanted to be Tory leader 9 years ago ?\",\n",

       " '1992 - 93 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports . ------------------------------------------------- Kings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04 / 18 / 93 The third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary , against the second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6 - 3 victory in front of a non - sellout crowd of 18 , 605 at the Saddledome in Calgary . Symthe Division playoff hockey this was . Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face - off . The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out - standing team defense . It took the Flames 9 : 45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal . The Kings , ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing , shut down the Flames . The Flames went 0 - 8 on the power play and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities . The Kings had their problems on the power play , yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries . The Kings forwards back - checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line , allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the Flames . Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex - pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday . Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg . He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to the dressing room for the rest of the game . Interviewed on the radio this morning , he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday . 1st period : 1 - 0 . The Kings got things started right off the opening face - off . Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor . He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net . The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom . He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up . Gretzky set up in \\' his office \\', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in . Sydor , who got the puck between the face - off dot and the hash mark , shot off the pass , beating Vernon low and between the legs . Millen and Fleury went off at 4 : 57 . Skrudland went off at 12 : 25 but the Kings failed to convert . Carson went off at 14 : 53 and the Flames failed to convert . Dahlquist went off at 18 : 34 and Dahl went off at 19 : 30 , giving the Kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert . The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period . 2nd period : The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on . With 6 seconds left in the 5on4 , Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game . 1 - 1 . Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play . Kurri , with the puck in the neutral zone , tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line . Suter skated down the near wing and into the Kings zone . He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri . As he cut thorugh the crease , he got Hrudey to go with him and he put the puck behind Hrudey , on his stick side for a short hander . 2 - 1 . The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play . Shuchuk , in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net . Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot where 2 Kings ( Shuchuk and Granato ) were being checked by 3 Flames . Carson came from the far corner , picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease . 3 - 1 . The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later . Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line . Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy . Huddy shot off the pass , from the near face - off dot , beating a diving Vernon on the glove side . 4 - 1 . 2 : 59 later , the Kings had a 3 goal lead . McSorley took a shot form the near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards . Marty got his own rebound , skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon . Skrudland went off at 10 : 53 but the Kings could not convert . Sydor went off at 12 : 35 and Watters went off at 14 : 40 , giving the Flames a 5 second 5 - 3 but they failed to convert . McSorley went off at 17 : 19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking at 17 : 31 . Sandstrom went off at 18 : 03 to close out the period . The Kings hit 3 goal post in the period . 3rd period : The Kings used the phrase \" Initiate , not retaliate \" and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game . 5 - 1 . The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1 : 06 mark . The Kings shot the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone . Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it . Donnelly , who was behind him , wacked at the puck , sending it into the low slot . As Vernon slid back in to the crease , Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon . Sydor went off at 1 : 24 ; Nieuwendyk went off at 3 : 22 as the teams skated 4 on 4 . 5 - 2 . Otto , skating down the far side , stepped around McSorley , cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot . Dahlquist cut through the top of the crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey . Carson and Rychel came in on a 2 - 1 . When Carson passed across to Rychel , Fleury tripped Rychel with no call . The puck got shoveled into the far corner where Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards , drawing a 5 - minute major and a game misconduct at the 6 : 08 mark . Unfortunately , the Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato ( at 6 : 44 ) and Watters ( at 8 : 19 ) took penalties . 5 - 3 . The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8 : 47 mark . MacInnis , at the near point , passed to Yawney at the far point . He took a few strides towards the net , wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey . The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost . Timeout - LA . 6 - 3 . MacInnis took a penalty at 9 : 56 and the Kings converted on the power play to seal the victory . Sandstrom , skating down the far wing in the Flames zone cut towards the back of the net . Just as he crossed the goal line , he passed the puck into the low slot , on the far side , to Carson who shot off the pass , beating Vernon on the ice , stick side . At the 16 : 17 mark , Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he went after Shuchuk . Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing , a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct , and he took the Flames right out of the game . On the plus side : The Kings , for the most part , played very disciplined hockey as they let Calgary retaliate . The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing . On the minus side : The Kings lost almost every face - off . This must improve or the Flames will surely get that power play back on track . Notes : ------ The Kings recalled Guy Leveque , Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix . Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point . The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against , giving the opposing team an average of 34 . 4 shots per game . Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3 - 9 - 1 record in afternoon games . The Flames entered the game with a 34 % success rate on the power play over their last 9 games . The teams were 3 - 3 - 1 against each other in the regular season .

I am astounded at the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only don ' t understand but publicly admit to not understanding . In fact , there ' s a plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins . For the record , there are two ways that a reliever can get a save : He must finish the game and either 1 . have entered the game with the tying run on base , at bat , or on deck . 2 . have pitched at least three innings effectively . A pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game . But this is an argument that * wins * is a dumb stat , not saves .

That \\' s an entirely different purpose than sending the letter to Bettman . Unfortunately ...

Now I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them . 65 people may be up there , thereby validating definition 2 . I would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large , which would give it a large scope . Why would he be impressed with this unless it were \" large \"?

Like I said , I don ' t know whether this story is true or just a rumor , but if it ' s true , don ' t look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon .

I ' m wondering if this is a recent change in stance for him ? Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter . He could always be fooled by a curve ball low and away . If this is indeed a new stance for him , maybe he is not being fooled as easily ? As for his patience , Dennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff . If he was grooving pitches to Andres , you can hardly fault him for drilling them ( which he did !). Does Andres generally start hot or cold ?

       " 'Well , it looks like , just as Doug trumped Tim , beating him to the net with his defensive analyses , so Tim has gotten in ahead of me . The way I was doing it was a little different . Being me , of course , I used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth , and I calculated both rate of performance ( fielding equivalent average ) and total performance ( fielding equivalent runs ). But I compared , not to the average player , but the replacement player , and here \\' s why : because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system . In the AL of 1992 , the average SS is 32 . 9 runs above replacement ( RAR ); cf , 31 . 6 ; 2B , 28 . 8 ; 3B , 26 . 3 ; LF , 26 . 0 ; RF , 24 . 6 ; 1B , 16 . 9 . We may quibble with the exact numbers , but the order looks substantially right . In the equivalent average , I have always set league average to . 235 . I had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of . 180 ; the name of that replacement level hitter , often as not , is \" Billy Ripken \". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the same distance from . 235 as . 180 , but in the opposite direction as I have set it up ; that makes for an eqa of . 280 . ( Yes , I can add . Runs are proportional to eqa squared ; the difference between 180 squared and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared , and I rounded off for simplicity ). An all - replacement fielding team would have : Randy Milligan at first (. 282 ), Willie Randolph (. 269 ) at second , Leo Gomez (. 279 ) at third , Walt Weiss (. 269 ) at short , Kevin Bass (. 271 ) in left , HoJo (. 257 ) in center , and Eric Anthony (. 277 ) in right . Ugh . So , the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and fielding RAR . I can rate them by total RAR , or RAR per some number of batting outs , like 400 . An average player has a total RAR of about 55 , 30 batting , 25 fielding . Total RAR ( bat / field ) 1 . Bonds 152 ( 124 / 28 ) Ventura 124 ( 66 / 58 ) 2 .

As a matter of fact , I can \\' t see any team in the American League winning either division on paper ( with the possible exception of the Yankees , who I hate ).

I \\' m basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis . \" Glenn Davis ? That \\' s insane \". Yes . So , without further ado : STRONG POINTS : Hoiles , Ripken some years , Olson , getting rid of Billy Ripken . WEAK POINTS : Segui may start . Valenzuela ( the original 30 - something ) may be the fifth starter . Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup . ( Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize the effect of a slumping Ripken ? If you can \\' t move Ripken out of the # 3 spot , why not move the rest of the line up ?)

WEAK POINTS : Mattingly still considered best hitter . The Steinbrenner factor . ( The Yankees lost to the Mets . Can wholesale changes be far behind ?) Never count on rookie pitchers ( i . e . Wickman & Millitello ) to win a division . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Boggs hits over . 300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN : Howe gets arrested again . ObPrediction : Mattingly won \\' t top a 700 OPS . 3 .

WEAK POINTS : The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick . Losing Stewart may hurt rotation ( that \\' s * really * a bad sign ). No one in the outfield can get on base . Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN : Club makes no major deals in August .

WEAK POINTS : Molitor gone . Surhoff at third ? Why ? Eldred can \\' t keep it up . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Listach and Eldred play like last year . WOULD BE BAD SIGN : Bones plays like last year . ObPrediction : Surhoff won \\' t finish the year at third . 5 . Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS : Baerga , Belle , Nagy WEAK POINTS : Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts .

Although I don ' t for one second believe Jose used steroids , his back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame ( see Jeff Bregel ex 49er as a textbook example ), and IMHO Jose is too big for his frame . I can ' t imagine how to estimate bat speed , but its pretty obvious that Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit , likely due to his back . I don ' t know , he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the A ' s , and had no problems with it then . It might be that pre - back problems , he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused , but now he ' s lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him . The old saying if you ' re hot its a trigger mechanism , if you ' re cold , its a hitch . The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he ' s comfortable with for more than a few months . He changes his stance so much , he loses track of where the strike zone is . In Wednesday ' s night game , he was clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me . I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he ' s changed his stance so much . I ' m also a bit concerned that because he ' s got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns , he ' ll become competitive , swing even harder and screw himself up even worse .

Gant is not entitled to time to regather his faculties . Nor is anyone else . Absolutely . I think it \\' d be more accurate to say Gant was foolish . If a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout , games would last about nine - fifteen weeks , if Jack Morris or Dave \" Whiner \" Stieb were pitching . A disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out . Suck it up , get back in the box , and never badmouth the blue .

As a result , I think I get more than my fair share of borderline calls at the plate , because I have a rep of having a good eye .

Roy stood on his head for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from end - to - end . Kamensky \\' s mini - break after the tying goal and the first shot by Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy . Roy outplayed Hextall for most of the game , but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero because Roy \\' s team didn \\' t make full use of their opportunities . Hextall , on the other hand , had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very well , but the Haller shot off the post in OT , the rebound bouncing over Bellows \\' stick , the Brunet breakaway , the 3 chances for LeClair ... all those opportunities were * not * finished off by Montreal , and it cost them . Hextall wasn \\' t particularly brilliant on those plays ... Sure , no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal . The timing stank , but against an explosive team like Quebec , they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary . I disagree . Roy played well because he wasn \\' t screened the whole night . The defense , for the 1st time this season , played remarkably , keeping Sakic , Nolan , and Sundin out of the slot most of the night . This most certainly was a team loss ... Leclair missed his opportunities , as did Bellows and Brunet . Dionne took a bad penalty . Damphousse and Lebeau were * silent *. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night . Roy gave up the bad goal . Roy , by no means , can be singled out for this loss . And Hextall didn \\' t on Dionne \\' s goal ? Please . Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5 , when you consider the defense , or lack of one , that played in front of him for most of the season . The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs . They are no better than uninformed fans . Why should they read the papers ? They played 58 minutes of \" Burnsian \" hockey to shut down Quebec . All they need tonight , and for the rest of the series is the extra 2 . Red Light to face Quebec ... rubbish . That \\' s a guaranteed way to end the series 4 - 0 . Who would be taught a lesson by this ? The fans , the media , and Racicot , perhaps . Certainly not the rest of the team . If you mean the goal should never have gone in , because there should never have been an OT , then I agree . But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Young . Roy had both the near and far posts covered , but Young flipped the puck up under Roy \\' s arm as he wrapped - around the net ... not a bad goal at all .',\n",
       " \"< In response to a debate about who has has a better season - Jagr of Francis > I think Jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time - stats don ' t exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better +/-. +/- is a useful statistic . If a player is on the ice when his team scores a lot of goals and only allows a few goals , he must be doing something right . It is especially useful to compare between teammates - as they play for the same team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally good players . It can be adjusted - with varying degrees of success to compare between players on different teams . I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics - but how useful are the ones that you suggest ?? Total ice time would be very useful - it is a missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before . Somehow measuring the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless . It would be a better stat for evaluating coaching - ie are the players given quality ice time actually their talented ones ? A very good player could be given low amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who doesn ' t recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that thinks he is an effective player . This stat would be much more flawed than +/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent . +/- is a useful stat . It is quite useful in evaluating player talent . You are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed is a very positive thing - and should be evaluated as such .\",\n",

       " 'I am looking for a source of American League baseball stats for individual players in the same format as printed in newspapers , ie .

       " \"I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues . The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis , as they had little talent on their roster for some time . Steve Avery , for example , was rushed to the majors , and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign . His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5 + ERA during his rookie year . Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound . Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors ( out of Arizona State directly ) had good numbers immediately . I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith , Craig McMurty , and Derek Lilliquist . The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed . Lilliquist and Smith struggled , but it didn ' t hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped . I seem to recall CM pitching well initially , though I don ' t have stats handy .\",\n",
       " \"Minor point : Shea Stadium was designed as a multi - purpose stadium but not with the Jets in mind as the tennant . The New York Football Giants had moved to Yankee Stadium ( from the Polo Grounds ) in 1958 and was having problem with stadium management ( the City did not own Yankee Stadium until 1972 ). The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea . When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the new AFL franchise , the New York Titans , approached the City about using the new stadium . The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium ( where the Cosmos played soccer in the 70s ). Because Shea Stadium was tied into the World ' s Fair anyway , the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the World ' s Fair ( like they were doing with the Mets ). So the deal was worked out . I ' m under the impression that when Murph says it , he means it ! As a regular goer to Shea , it is not a bad place since they ' ve cleaned and renovated the place . Remember , this is its 30th Year !\",\n",

       " 'Okay , I think we all agree that singles hitters should take a strike or two and try to get on base any way they can . So the \" No Power / Impatient \" guys have no excuse . The \" No Power / Patient \" guys are doing the right thing . Now the \" Impatient / Power \" guys ( how could you leave out the Big Cat ?). Would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took more pitches ? Perhaps , but I doubt it . If you tell Joe Carter to go up there and take a few pitches , he will draw more walks , but he also won \\' t hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive . The \" Patient / Power \" guys ? Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and Rickey Henderson has \" a strike zone the size of Hitler \\' s heart \" so they get their walks based on the small zone . Look at the other 5 guys : Thomas , Bonds , McGwire , Ruth and Williams . Wow ! A lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them . The pitchers would do better ( in my opinion ) by just coming after them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch , but pitchers would rather nibble , go 2 - 0 or 3 - 1 and then get hurt .',\n",

We ' re talking about 1993 , you know . If that were your purpose , maybe . Offerman spent 1992 getting acclimated , if you will . The Dodgers as a team paid a big price that season . Perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road . Do you really think they would have done what they did if they were competing for a pennant ? For a stat - head , I ' m amazed that you put any credence in spring training . Did you notice who he got those 10 (!) hits off of , or are you going to tell me that it doesn ' t make a difference ? Wait a minute . I missed something here . First , forget Keith Mitchell . Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA and then does not improve would have been better off making a direct leap to the majors ? If a player does well at AA and then does not improve at AAA , isn ' t that a sign that maybe he doesn ' t belong in the bigs ? Now , Keith Mitchell . As I recall ( no stat books handy - surprise !) he jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991 . He did so well that he was returned to the minors , where he didn ' t do very well at all . Now his career is in jeopardy . So how does he fit in with your point . Good MLE ' s in AA . Moved him right to the big club . Now he ' s one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball .

       " 'So far Simmons looks like a total idiot . 1 ) Zane Smith should learn how to \" switchpitch \" and return from the DL . I would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all . 2 ) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an impressive win last week . NOw Otto \\' s latest debacle has restored Simmon \\' s reputation . Now he looks like he is back in his \\' 92 form when he had the AL \\' s highest ERA among starters . Four our sake ( not Ted \\' s sake ), I hope he pitches with a 3 . 5 ERA for the rest of the season . Yeah , right . 3 ) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing . They are still doing decently . BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons , they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse . Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters . Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year . He showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year . 4 ) Walk : Well , he seems to be on the losing end tonight . BUt I still think that Walk desrved his contract . 5 ) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation . I can \\' t understand his and management \\' s fear of losing Tom Prince through waivers . Even if they do , what \\' s the use . He is aright hander like Slaught . Not a very smart platoon . Also , I am blaming Leyland in this case , since he is hcurrently convinced that LaVAlliere is through , while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs ( SLaught should have played in all 7 games ; he has a good average against right handed pitching ). Didn \\' t Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year , and attempt to trade LaValliere last year itself ? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere wasn \\' t very fit last year . 6 ) Dennis MOeller is SCARY !!! 7 ) Candeleria : Well , he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the season . Maybe it will be in 3 - 4 range . BUt $ 1 million plus ? Come on . Other than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks , Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year . So far , he seems to have pitched well for the Rangers . I think the PIrates should have spent the money on Patterson in stead . 8 ) The Rookie batters : Well , Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact . Other than that , their excellent performance hasn \\' t been too much of a surprise . I think we should thank Doughty for that . 9 ) Rookie Pitchers : Worse than expected , especially Cooke . 10 ) Slaught : How come he wasn \\' t given a contract extension last year ? NOw his value has increased immensely . 11 ) Lonnie Smith !! Well , Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount . Let \\' s see . Eric can hit better . He can run better . He can field better . Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis . An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Smith . Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year , he won \\' t be an asset . He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field . 12 ) Management : BIG BIG ZERO . Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing . He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay . 13 ) Alex Cole fiasco . The PIrates infield and CF positions look good . The RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace two of the four outfielders . Eric Davis , Van Slyke and Cole would have made a very respectable outfield . Even without Eric Davis , thye PIrates would have a respectable outfield with Cole , SVan Slyke , and Merced ( I think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting ). Simmons did have options for the outfield . Ironically , the biggest accomplishment of Simmon \\' s tenure was getting Alex Cole really cheap . Too bad . 14 ) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds : Forget it . The pirates can rant and rave . they will not get those picks . As of now , the issue is still being appealed . Now , if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots , nothing else will . On a final note . Tim Wakefield won \\' t be as awful as he was in his last 2 starts . BUt don \\' t count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season . Also , if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season , they will miss Redus \\' s clutch hitting and his speed ( he has peaked in the second half of the last 2 seasons )>',\n",
       " 'Take a look at the standings . It \\' s REAL easy to get so focussed on minutinae and forget that the Giants happen to be in first place . If it \\' s working , you don \\' t SCREW IT UP by changing things , just because you think it ought to be different . Some folks like to argue about theoretical details . I prefer to watch teams win . When the Giants slip to third , then we can talk about how to re - arrange the batting order . Until then , I think it \\' s stupid to focus on what \\' s wrong , for the simple fact that IT \\' S WORKING AS IT IS . In the majors ? I don \\' t follow AL , so I won \\' t comment on \" Majors \". In the NL , if I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team , it \\' d be Clark , and I \\' d hit him third . ( My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it , because I \\' ve never been able to GET Clark . I \\' d take any of the three without hesitation in real life , but I think Clark is it ). Williams : Not even close . I much prefer his defense , but when he isn \\' t headcasing it , Matt has a good , solid swing and some real punch . If he drops to . 230 , then he wanders out of cleanup , but according to the latest Baseball Weekly , he \\' s hitting . 275 , and in the last week , hitting . 296 .

       " \"While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory , I think it must be realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis Joseph . When a goalkeeper gets hot , there is little an opposing team can do . Joseph should be given the entire city of St . Louis , because otherwise there would probably be a game 6 scheduled . As for the game on Sunday . The Blues caught a few breaks , without a doubt . One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks , looking for reasons to give them penalties . Second , The Blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear . No linesman , no shot for Brett ( I can redirect anything ) Hull to redirect . On another of St . Louis ' goals , Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who didn ' t belong in the crease , which means it was a St . Louis player . Finally , the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease . No goalie , no way to stop the shot . I congratulate St . Louis for beating the Hawks . It will be a shame to see Bryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph won ' t be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack . ____________________________________________________________________________\",\n",

Viola seems to have rebounded nicely . How long did Viola sign for . Three years ? I generally agree with their policy of avoiding long - term contracts for pitchers . But I think they enforce it rather too strictly . These days the premier pitchers all sign three or four year deals . Which leaves the Jays with Morris and Stewart . If the Jays want to compete for top free agent pitchers , they will have to accept greater risks . Any idea what the option year deal is for Morris ? Are there any automatic activation clauses ?

       " 'A - hem . Two words : Russell Davis . Playing in the cavern at Albany ( AA ) last year ( 375 / 410 / 385 down the alleys and to center ), Davis went . 285 /. 355 /. 483 with 22 homers . There aren \\' t any small parks on the road in the Eastern League , either . He \\' s 23 (!) and his MLE was . 258 /. 308 /. 416 , 17 HR . I have no fielding statistics , but from seeing him a number of times last year I \\' d say that he \\' s not Brooks Robinson , but neither is he Howard Johnson . Unless they think they can win the pennant * this year * ( which seems possible ) and need Boggs to do it , I think they \\' re making the same sort of mistake with Davis that Boston made with Boggs , leaving him in the minors for two or three years after he \\' d shown that he was a good hitter . Hrm ? They still have him on the roster ( 16 AB through the first two weeks ). They \\' ve just never figured out what to do with him . I suspect that he hits enough ( especially vs . lefties ) to be a reasonable shortstop . One rumor running around during spring training was that they wanted to convert Silvestri to be a catcher (!) because \" his body type was wrong for a shortstop \".

If Probert smashes Gilmour ' s head into the boards next week , will that diminish your assessment of Gilmour ' s skills ? I would take Fuhr and Sanderson off of the latter .

From what I have read Niedermayer is the best skater in the draft , plays BOTH offense and defense , and isn ' t afraid of physical play .

I thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this season to stop crap like that ?!? Is it just me , or does the officiating just still stink to high heaven ? IMHO , if they could get rid of the existing refs , and institute a new system with more than one ref on the ice to keep an eye on the trouble - makers then a lot of these things would stop , and then the game would be ruled by the finnesse players : Mario , Selanne , Bure , Messier , et . al ...',\n",

       " \"The Giants always hit Maddux well , but it was interesting that Maddux did not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night . He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night , got away with the first one , but Bonds hit the second one out of the park . Then in the 3rd , when Clark was at third base with one out , Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds , and Bonds dropped a single to left - center . The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet . He will always hit around . 300 , but I ' m concerning about his on - base percentage . The key in the lineup is Matt Williams , he has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base . The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL . Burba has done a superb job filling in so far , he looks like a different pitcher from last year . However , Swift is terrible in both of his starts . With Burba moving into the rotation , Mike Jackson is the only right - handed reliever aside from Rod Beck , he ' ll get a lot of actions . I also hope that Dusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig , especially on Beck . I was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week . So far so good !\",\n",
       " '^^ Funny you should mention it ... this is exactly the case I was going to make . I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans , even if the team sucks . But this is short term only ; I still do not think the attendance increase will last , unless the team is a winning / competitive / improving / butt - kicking one . Pittsburgh was still getting better , so people continued to support them . If they suddenly dropped to , say , 50 points , you \\' d have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon . Ok . My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book . You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it . But my point is that it wasn \\' t Mario himself , but it was the * expectation * of things to come ( i . e . a winning team ) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar . And before anybody jumps in and says I \\' m nit - picking and mincing words , go back and read from where this thread started ... It might help to think about what would go through a fan \\' s mind who suddenly found an interest in Mario and the Pens . Was it \" gee , Mario Lemieux is amazing , I \\' ll go watch him play \", or was it \" gee , now we \\' ve got a * kick * * ass * guy on * our * side , I \\' ll go watch him play \". I think it was the latter . I don \\' t think this is accurate . The * tickets * sell , but people don \\' t go to the games . I think this thread has already been discussed ... season ticket holders in LA don \\' t always use their tickets . So in effect , after the Kings initial success following Gretzky \\' s arrival ( 68 to 91 points , same source ) and corresponding attendance jump , there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much . Whether or not the Kings are a \\' winner \\' is debatable . I claim that since Gretzky \\' s arrival they have at the very least been competitive ... I also claim that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler dynasty ... but that \\' s another story and included only because I don \\' t like McNall :-). Anyway , McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky , and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales , etc . But as I said , when the Kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the Forum even if the tickets were sold . For the short term , IMO . Although I think that it \\' s inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky , simply because they make people around them better . Well , at least we are in full agreement here ! So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point ? < couldn \\' t resist ...> Yes , but they are doing no worse than last year . I think the same type of reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at Winnipeg games .

It was part of their preseason special . Basically , they looked at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances ( or ABs ) by the time they were 24 , and noticed some interesting things . For starters , they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game . They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame . The kicker , though , was that they actually did some number - crunching and found that such players ' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group . They also found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals ( HRs , etc ) of the other players . The first group outhit the second something like . 282 to . 260 in raw BA , and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs , 2Bs , RBIs , etc .

       " 'The problem with your nihilistic approach , Roger , is that it takes all the sense out of the game . By your line of reasoning , if a guy hits into a double play with one out and the bases loaded , there \\' s no point in saying that that was a bad thing to do ( if his team won anyway ) or speculating on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise , so the double play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was eventually won or lost for unknown reasons . After all , any speculation involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn \\' t . Roger , do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead ? Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence ? Teams go to the post - season when they win more games than anybody else in their division . If they don \\' t make the post - season , they don \\' t win the Series . Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ring - collecting ? If so , you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal towards winning the division , and our disagreements come when we consider how to win games . In your viewpoint as expressed , winning games happens for reasons that cannot be analyzed . While many of us are thinking things like \" Base - runners are good , outs are bad , and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded \", you are thinking things like \" It \\' s a team game , so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today \". The result is that it becomes impossible to say * anything * about individual players . Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing left field . After all , perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it . Therefore , I could be an extremely valuable player . Did Dave Winfield have anything to do with the Jays \\' victory ? Probably , but how do you know ? If you replace him with Andres Galarraga , perhaps the Jays would have won , perhaps they would have lost , perhaps they would have defected to Alpha Centauri ( bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in mid - season had Winfield been DHing for Toronto ). Was Babe Ruth a good player ? He played on some WS - winning teams , but did he have anything to do with their success ? It is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player , and Jarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder weren \\' t . It seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof . Now , we have observed things about baseball over the years , both empirically and by looking at the rulebook . It is necessary to score more runs than one \\' s opponent to win the game , so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent one \\' s opponent from scoring . Runs are scored while a team is batting , and an inning ends after the third out , so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good . Players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels , and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year . We do use these statistics to predict winners , and so do you . To make some flat predictions : Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP + SLG than Gene Larkin this year . The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies in the standings . The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals , but will also give up more . I would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false , and , I suspect , so would you . As a matter of fact , I am pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year , given 3 - 4 guesses per division , and this is certainly better than random chance ( and almost statistically significant ). If you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet in the World Series , you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods , however fuzzy . So how about \" real life \"? Person A robs a service station with two people in it , using a . 38 automatic pistol , gets $ 42 , and is convicted and sentenced for three years . Person B , with a similar criminal record , robs a service station with two people in it , using a . 38 revolver , gets $ 42 , and is convicted . Since they used two different types of handgun , are comparisons totally meaningless ? Say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works ( my cats are always testing this - they don \\' t trust me to pay the gravity bill on time ). You have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before , so all previous evidence is meaningless ? Or would you be surprised if it flew out the window instead of hitting the desk ?',\n",
       " 'Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate , with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times . My opinion , FWIW , to all : Mark , age doesn \\' t matter ; ability does . I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best . I don \\' t care if he is 15 ; if he plays better than what I have , I want him out there . Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers , grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular ; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter ( which is good for a catcher , I \\' ll admit ). Santiago \\' s numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy \\' s , but I don \\' t have the league data from the mid - 80s to check it out . That being said , I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond , at least to start the season . As the box below shows , he has * one * minor league season in which he hit well . He has two in which he hit very , very poorly . I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real . Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities ; for catchers , especially NL catchers , they are essentially average hitters , with equivalent averages around . 220 . If he had hit well at prior levels , I would say he belongs on the Braves ; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87 . One year at any level , at any age , doesn \\' t satisfy MY standards of evidence .

But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play ; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates ; and at a still young age ( 24 ), had a monster year with an 868 OPS . He has a total , major and minor , EQA of . 249 ; above major league average , and above average for CF ( which was about . 240 in the NL last year ). He has shown at least the potential of going into the . 290s , which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league . He has two full seasons before reaching his \" prime \" season of 27 .

       " \"The same Bill James ? Why do you say that ? It sounds like you ' re suggesting Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death . Au contraire ; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign , noting that he wasn ' t all - world as a catcher or a hitter . He called him basically average when everyone * else * in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella . Which reports are those ? I like Hernandez a lot , but if Piazza can catch the ball , you ' ve gotta play him IMHO . He ' s a much better hitter , although Hernandez isn ' t a * bad * hitter . Right now , it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti ' s caddy since he can catch the knuckler . As long as they play up to their abilities , the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem . I think both are overrated defensively ( see Nichols ' Law of catcher defense ), but that ' s something that ' s difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine . About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent ' s SB %, and that ' s clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners . Catchers ERA is a possibility , but it ' s subject to way too many biases . As for them ' playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat ', I disagree here too . About the only chink in the Braves ' armor is that they ' re weak offensively at several positions ( CF , C , 2B , SS if Belliard plays , 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super - platoon ) and very weak defensively if Blauser plays . I ' d like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves , Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot , but much like the talent - rich Jays of recent years they ' ll be conservative and stick with what they have . I ' m not saying that ' s wrong , just conservative .\",\n",
       " \"Hey ! What ' s this ? We agree ! No platoon advantage ( Sabo vs . Samuel ). Both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters , and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with slow curves and change ups . Sabo has more power , and a little bit of a better batting eye . Samuel is noted as an agressive free - swinger . Sabo has more homerun power . Both players started the game hitting below . 200 . There may have been some game considerations that might have prompted Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later . But the game * was * on the line , and Samuel never did get in . Given all of this , I don ' t see a lot to suggest pinch - hitting , nor do I see anything to suggest no pinch - hitting . There is , of course , the clutch - hitting information .

If ( even more amazingly ) they get past the Hawks , they would probably face Vancouver , and lose . As for The Habs reaching the Finals , forget it .

       " 'Sorry , Sherri , but I can \\' t agree with this particular incident . While I \\' m all for cutting down the number of chain - rattles and other examples of rampant Hargroving , there was a difference here . 1 ) Since time immemorial , batters have complained about calls . So have pitchers and catchers . Usually , nothing happens . Unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing complaints , Hirschbeck was acting against expectations . 2 ) It \\' s not as if Gant was \" in Hirschbeck \\' s face \". Gant said something about the call , stepped out of the box , and turned away from Hirschbeck . As a hitter ( alibet of little consequence , but with a decent eye ), whenever receiving the short end of the stick on a questionable call , I \\' d want a moment or two out of the box , if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on the experience of the last pitch . And if I was really angry at the ump , I \\' d rather turn away and catch my breath than turn to him and say something that might get me tossed , especially at a key moment in the game . When Gant turned away , Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant to step into the box . IMO , at this point in time , Hirschbeck was determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game . Gant wasn \\' t dawdling ; he hadn \\' t had a chance to dawdle . And Hirschbeck was simply exercising a power play . Gant resisted , as many of us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request , and Hirschbeck called for the pitch . At that point , Cox came out on the field , the pitch was thrown , and many other Braves left the dugout . Cox was tossed \" protecting his player \". I was pleasantly surprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game . It \\' s a small sample size , but based on what I saw in that game , Mark Hirschbeck has a hair - trigger temper and a need to play God on the field . Not good qualities for an umpire . I will keep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the future , in order to improve my sample size . IMO , any game where you remember the name of the umpire was a bad game for the umpire .',\n",

Answers to some frequently asked questions : Q : Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs ?

       " 'As the heading indicates , it is impossible for me to fathom why Barry is not batting 4th for the Giants behind Will Clark . Barry is such an awesome and consistent hitter -- definitely the best in the National League . IMHO , to have Williams , a streaky hitter ( and not really a clutch hitter ) batting 4th ahead of Bonds is simply an injustice to the Giants and fans of the Giants .',\n",

       " 'Finns had to do their best last night when they played against Norway in world champs . After two periods the score was still 0 - 0 . This game was quite much similar to the first game Finland played ( against France ). The norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky , too . In the third period Juha Riihij { rvi scored 1 - 0 from a rebound , the time was around 5 mins or so . The second goal was scored by Kari Harila , who shot straight from a faceoff behind the Nowwegian goalie . Saku Koivu , the 18 - year - old center got his first point of this tournament . Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and he was awarded the best player of the game - prize . Despite the fact that he is quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater . I think that we will hear from this guy in the future .',\n",
       " \"But , THEY FACED THE PHILLIES -- A TEAM THAT GOT OFF TO AN 8 - 1 START . To be honest , I think the city of Houston loves the new owner . He has brought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players that were from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros . I don ' t think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team as he has already admitted that he doesn ' t know a whole lot about baseball . McLane is a businessman , and doesn ' t like excuses . He makes a valid point that injuries shouldn ' t be an excuse to this club . Look at the depth of the bench this season .. Canadele can play 7 positions ; Bass and James are solid outfielders and can hit well too ; Uribe is nice to have as well .. The pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters . We ' re dealing with a young Houston team , so injuries shouldn ' t play a big role . The only threat is the bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out , we may be in trouble but with the type of starters we have this season , there is less pressure on the pen .\",\n",
       " 'the owners are whining about baseball not being popular among a large enough portion of the population , and have suggested various \" remedies \", such as shortening the game or trying to convince us that \" smoke \\' embake \\' emdominatebysheerintimidation \" is an accurate description of what is , essentially , a laid - back game . forget those lame ideas . here is my new and exciting two - point plan to generate interest in baseball among the masses . point one : sex . point two : violence . let \\' s face it , sex and violence are the only things that sell in america . here \\' s how we can implement them in the game : sex : cheerleaders , cheerleaders , and more cheerleaders . dancing on top of the dugouts . bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh inning stretch . running up and down the stands . ( the south bend white sox actually do this ). violence : baseball players are such utter wuss boys . the pitcher beans the batter , and both benches empty in what is called a \" bench - clearing brawl \". EVERYBODY JUST STANDS THERE AND LOOKS AT EACH OTHER . stand , stand , stand . look , look , look . ho , hum . then , the bullpens come running in . when they reach the \" fight \", they just stand there , too . anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch should be suspended and fined . further , the bullpens should fight it out in the outfield , so as not to waste time and energy running to the infield . football : sex , violence . basketball : sex , violence . hockey : violence . baseball : \" da pastime of da nayshun !\" - yawn .',\n",
       " \"-- Minnesota definitely deserves an NHL franchise !!! You ' ll see the Minnesota Whalers pretty soon , so fear not Minnesota fans .

       " \"Exactly my point . If you ' d watch games more closely , you ' d see a lot of goons going after him . Ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical players for Pgh are left alone . Ulf plays rough hockey , but only when other players are putting the rush on Mario or Jagr . If you want to say anyone on the Penguins is a cheap shot or a goon , say it ' s Jennings or Caufield . Don ' tslander a good defenseman because your favorite players can ' t beat the Pens even when they take dives ( like Gartner ) to try for the cheap penalties . Hey , that ' s fine ! If a player does something stupid , he should be penalized including Ulf . Or Mario ( you ' re not likely to see that happen ) or anyone else for that matter . It ' s pointless to say any one person is a cheap - shot goon , because you ' ll see EVERYONE take a cheap shot now and then , especially if you ' resomeone who is shadowed as much as Ulf is .\",\n",
       " \"Detroit is a very disciplined team . There ' s a lot of Europeans in Detroit which would make the game fast , so Toronto would have to slow the game down , which means drawing penalties , as a last resort anyway . Toronto will be a good team as soon as they get more good players . Toronto is just an average team , Detroit isn ' t Ballard screwed Toronto when he was owner . Everyone knows that . and it ' s going to take time for Toronto to become a real force . I expect Gilmour to be burnt out next year . He can ' t pull the whole team forever .\",\n",
       " \"Hi . According to my always questionable newspaper , there ' s a silver dollar being minted in Canada , the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the Stanley Cup . Now , I know full well what coins are used every day in Canada . I can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now , in fact . My question is , since the loon is the only dollar coin that I know is legal tender , is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value , or what ? Is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet , with no chance of it being circulated ? If it is an uncirculated coin , what ' s the current cost and what ' s its potential value ? Just curious . If no one knows , I ' ll take this to soc . culture . canada and rec . collecting ( or whatever it is ). Thanks again\",\n",

       " 'Whatever you say . I think it \\' s just 12 games into the season myself , so I \\' m going to wait a bit before calling names . I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher , and I have no idea why Simmons ever wanted him . On the other hand , I expect him to release Otto if he doesn \\' t turn things around pretty fast . ( BTW , Otto \\' s game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22 , which points out a problem with the method since Otto \\' s performance was infinitely bad , and excruciatingly prolonged .) I think Merced \\' s rookie year was a bit flukey , but aren \\' t you willing to give him some more at bats ( and Tomlin a few more starts ) before acting so gloomy ? No he didn \\' t . Walk is a time bomb . He has no stuff whatsoever , and when the league finally realizes this , it won \\' t be pretty at all . Don \\' t be so fast . Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele , which was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors . Meanwhile , I \\' m not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a six - year free agent before the 1992 season . Twice through the rotation , and you \\' ve given up ? Yikes . But so has his age , at least in baseball terms . The useful half - life of a 34 - year - old injury - prone catcher can \\' t be much longer than a year . But he wanted to be a Dodger , and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous 1992 . I don \\' t think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign him . He certainly wasn \\' t last year . Hey , that \\' s the \" Skates Smith \" package deal . Anybody who acquires Lonnie for his defense or base - running ( particularly at this stage ) is a real weirdo . If that \\' s the goal of the team ownership , than I don \\' t see why Sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy . I don \\' t know what he has or hasn \\' t said about revenue sharing , so I can \\' t comment there . It \\' s annoying , but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain Jeff King , it was probably unavoidable . Meanwhile , I think bigger accomplishments of Simmons \\' tenure were getting some value for John Smiley , not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year , drafting well in 1992 , letting the rookies show something in 1993 . Foley , Smith , and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts , which means that even if fail it hasn \\' t done serious damage to the Bucs \\' future . Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case ? I never heard the outcome of this . When will the final verdict be in on this ? I \\' m not sure who was the idiot in this case , so I don \\' t know who to blame . It might have been Doug Danforth , after all . In fact , I * seriously * suspect it was Doug Danforth , who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his feet .

I would guess that a tiny fraction of 1 % of the folks reading your post agree with it . I kind of doubt that even you agree with it . I ' m not going to go through your points one at a time , because , after all , not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball . I ' m only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema , the AAA umpire who sued ( is suing ?) baseball on the grounds of sex discrimination because she wasn ' t promoted to the majors . I ' ve never seen her ump a game . I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire . But I have seen her on talk shows . And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most . It seems to me that she is missing the point and if that ' s how she sees the role of umpires in the game , well I wouldn ' t promote her either . The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out ; hell , Joe Lundy could do that . Their primary function is to maintain order in the game , keep the game moving , and keep the players from trying to kill each other . Umpires have to be extremely tough people . That disqualifies most of us , both men and women . And if Ms . Postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook , then I think that disqualifies her as well . Umpires need to command the game ; command of the rulebook is secondary .\",\n",

The Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC ( ch 9 ) in Windsor where we see Don Cherry ' s Coaches Corner between periods .

Personally , I ' ve had my fill of Donny ! He really pisses me off sometimes . During the Detroit - Toronto game Monday night on CBC , Don gave high praise to Doug Gilmour , saying he was a two - way player and not just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player in the game because of that . That ' s fine and I agree that Gilmour is a good two - way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman about a month ago on a local radio talk show . What gives ? It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from city to city . Don Cherry : ' I think < insert star player name for city that he is in > is the best two - way player in the league today .'

Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario Lemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs from the Civic Center ( Yes , I think the Pens will make it out of the Wales Conference ) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about Lemieux .

When he was up 6 - 1 in a ballgame , he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters \" get themseleves out \" ( I hate this expression !). An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down . But Morris , being a veteran pitcher , knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball . By saving himself , he was able to reach back for that little extra ( I hate this too !) when the game was on the line . Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year , but let \\' s not change history to suit the present .

It \\' s an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears , the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House . I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship . And we \\' re glad to have them here . I \\' m inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship , but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory . Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size , but also filled with pride and tradition and community , I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears . In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team , and that was back in 1978 . I \\' m sure that 15 years from now , the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today . You know , in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey . We don \\' t have a lot of ice . ( Laughter .) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town , I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here . Hockey is a tough game . It \\' s a hard - hitting sport . It does have one virtue though , there \\' s a penalty for delay of game . I wish we had that rule in the Senate . ( Laughter .) In government as in hockey , leadership is important . In the United States Senate , our team has a great captain , the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine , George Mitchell ; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young , I can \\' t imagine . ( Laughter .) I \\' m actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me . On your hockey team , the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job . He scored the winning goal late in the championship game , leading you to a come - from - behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about . Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities . I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team , how to bring out the best in one another , and how to come from behind . I think it \\' s important , as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together , to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country , to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives . We now have another role model , and I \\' m glad to have them here today . ( Applause .) ( The President is presented with team jersey .) ( Applause .) THE PRESIDENT : That \\' s great . I love it . It \\' s beautiful . ( Applause .) ( The President is presented with an autographed stick .) THE PRESIDENT : Thank you . That \\' s great . ( Applause .) * * * * * * Q Mr . President , did you authorize the move on Waco this morning , sir ? THE PRESIDENT : I was aware of it . I think the Attorney General made the decision . And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI . Q Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed ? THE PRESIDENT : No , they made the tactical decisions . That was their judgment , the FBI . Q Is this a raid ? THE PRESIDENT : And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI . I knew it was going to be done , but the decisions were entirely theirs , all the tactical decisions . Q What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning ? Q Any chance for that stimulus package ? THE PRESIDENT : Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter . ( Laughter .) I was in there -- ( laughter ). SENATOR MITCHELL : You have to pay that quarter . THE PRESIDENT : I was ready . ( Laughter .) Senator Mitchell , he \\' s worth a quarter any day . Q Any chance for your bill , sir ? THE PRESIDENT : We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we \\' re going to have for the rest of the week . We only had about five minutes to talk . And we agreed we \\' d get back together later , around noon , and talk some more . Q Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise . THE PRESIDENT : Well , I know he did , but , look , Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983 ; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $ 100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President , in those administrations . And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work . I don \\' t want to go back and revisit every one , but you can do it . You can look at the research there . So this position they \\' re taking is not credible . We have a very tough five - year deficit reduction plan . All these costs are covered during that time and then some . And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don \\' t have much of a history on which to base their position . They \\' ve got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work . So I think we \\' ve got a chance to work it out , and I \\' m hopeful . We \\' ll see what happens today and tomorrow . I \\' m feeling pretty good about it . THE PRESS : Thank you END 10 : 10 A .

This telecast will primarily seen on the East Coast . St . Louis at Chicago - Mike Emrick ( play - by play ), Jim Schoendfeld ( color ) and Tom Mees roaming the halls . This telecast will primarily be seen in the Midwest and parts of the South . LA at Calgary - Al \" Do You Believe in Mircales ?\" Michaels ( play by play ), John Davidson ( color ) and Mark Jones as a roaming reporter . This telecast will be seen in the Western USA . Montreal \\' s naitive , Jon Saunders will be hosting in the studio . ABC will do \" Up and Close and Personal \" with Mario during Saturday \\' s Wide World of Sports ( 4 : 30EDT ). Sunday will be the first NHL playoff or regular network telecast in 13 years ... not counting those silly All - Star games on NBC for the last few years ... For Sunday \\' s games , ABC will use 8 mikes ( 2 behind on the goal ), super - super - slo - mo , close - ups of player \\' s faces at face - offs . ESPN / ABC will not be able to use its new favorite toy , the ice - level shot , in Pittsburgh where too many seats would have to removed to employ it ... In case of a blowout in progress in Pittsburgh , ABC will switch to Chicago game but will come back to the Pittsburgh game for updates or if the game gets closer ( Ha !).. ABC expects huge ratings ( by hockey standards ) since all 3 Top US TV - markets are involved - NY metro area ( NY Islanders / NJ Devils ), Chicago ( BlackHawks ), and LA ( Kings ). Stay tuned , Thanks Mike ,',\n",

       " \"I watched the final inning of Bosio ' s no - hitter with several people at work . After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle , someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove , he wouldn ' t have had time to throw Riles out . Yet , the throw beat Riles by about two steps . I wonder how many others who watched the final out think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand . Does anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded ? And if he failed to field it cleanly , would it ( or should it ) have been an error or a hit ? ( Judging from Bosio ' s grimace when the ball bounced past him , he must have thought it would go through for a hit .) Whether Vizquel was right or wrong , he certainly made one hell of a play . -- -------------------------- Phil Brown | aka pb6755 @ csc . albany . edu |\",\n",
